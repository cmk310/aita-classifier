120	220	adjudicated	TTA	"I have an 8 year old son with my ex. We separated almost 4 years ago when I learned he was sleeping around throughout most of our marriage and he even had a girlfriend for over a year. He moved in with her after I started divorce proceedings. Their son was born during the divorce. Ex and I share custody and split Christmas every year. We do all our communication through an app. Or we're supposed to anyway.

Ex's girlfriend left him and their son just after the baby turned 1. He's now 3.

Whenever I see ex's mom, who lives 20 minutes from me, she always mentions how she wishes I was the mom to her other grandson and how sad it is he doesn't have a mom. I was always a little suspicious of comments like that because what good do they do? It made me aware that he and his family might want me to be involved in this little boy's life.

Last week ex texted me and said he was thinking about the future. How he has two boys and how he wants his son to grow up with memories of Christmas always including his brother and maybe having more family than he currently does. So how about we stop with the conflict and come together every Christmas and I could get to know his son more and be part of his life and we would both see our son Christmas Day. He brought up how our son isn't really as close to his son as he wanted him to be and that his son smiles whenever he sees me and would love to interact with me. The text was long and he brought up a lot of points. To sum it up he wanted us to do joint Christmas' going forward and for me to be in his son's life. I ignored the part about his son and I said no to joint Christmas'. Ex did not leave it there and he tried to convince me by using the ""I know you hate Christmas when our son isn't with you"" and he's not wrong. But we are not going to get along enough for that. His cheating ended any chance for that. I also do not want his son to become attached to me or seek a mom figure in me.

So I said no and no again when he didn't give up and I stopped replying.

I saw ex and his mom Wednesday when I was grabbing some groceries while my son was at his best friend's house. They came right up to me and said I should be more compassionate and see the win in having Christmas all together. His mom again mentioned how sad it is that his son doesn't have a mom and ex told me I am going to come between the boys if our son figures out how much I don't want to be around his half brother. He told me to do better and stop being such an ass to him and his son. His mom was like ""be the amazing mom we know you are"". She wasn't mad but he was furious and I know it won't be the least time he brings it up.

AITA?"
128	126	adjudicated	TTA	When I (30F) was in grad school I was dating John (42M) long distance. I often struggled with money as an underpaid grad student, but with the help of my parents I made it work. During my relationship with John, when we would be fighting or generally not getting along, he started sending me chunks of money ($400-500) randomly. I would ask what for and he would say things like “just to help you with your bills.” At first I would immediately send it back. He was well off and I didn’t want him to think that I was using him for his money. After a while I started to notice that he always did it when we were fighting and got suspicious of his intentions. One day, he sent $500 and I didn’t immediately send it back. Sure enough, about 30 minutes later he asks “Well, are you going to send it back?” I ask “Why? Didn’t you send it to help me with bills?” And he starts getting mad and saying things like “Why do you think you deserve it? You didn’t earn that money.” To which I replied “Then why did you send it?” With that, he confirmed my suspicions: he was sending the money not to actually help me, but to make it LOOK like he was helping me to get brownie points and do some sort of loyalty test. So I told him “Look. I’ll send it back. But don’t ever send me money unsolicited again. If you do, I will keep it. I’m tired of you testing me. If you don’t want me to have it, don’t send it.” That stopped it for about a year. Then fast forward, another period where we aren’t getting along and I was mostly ignoring his calls and texts. Eventually he gets his friend to call me and they’re talking about stuff and casually mention that he sent me some money. I check my PayPal and he’d sent $2,000. I ask why and he says “I know you’re struggling. It’s to help with bills and stuff.” Furious that he’d done it again, I decided to teach him an expensive lesson. I didn’t send it back. Sure enough, about an hour later he starts freaking out. He asked why I wasn’t sending it back and why I thought I deserved it. I reminded him over and over of the last time: how I’d told him if he did it again, I would keep it and use it for bills. This made him furious. He threatened to break up with me, never talk to me again, etc. After a while of me not budging, he seemingly let it go. Well, we’ve since broken up for other reasons but remained friends in some capacity. I hadn’t thought about the money again until last night when he brought it up during a phone call. I reiterated that I had told him I would keep it and I was sick of him “testing my loyalty” with money and that I was tired of him trying to manipulate me into thinking he was helping me when he had no intentions of actually helping me. He confirmed that he never intended for me to keep the money, which to me confirmed it was all about manipulation. He was mad I stuck to my guns and hung up on me but I don’t care. I think he needed that very expensive lesson to learn to stop trying to manipulate people with money. So, AITA for keeping the money?

As I do all the grocery shopping, I buy 24 Hersey bars, 72 Sour Straw bars, and 24 boxes of Good'n'Plenty. (I priced it out on multiple websites and grocery stores before buying.) I will also pick up a 10 pound bag of Tootsie Pops / Tootsie Rolls later in case we have a lot of kids, as I have been warned we are in the ""rich people"" subdivision and there are a lot of kids that stop by. Maybe some Lemonheads too, idk.

My wife told me I was an asshole for buying licorice Good'n'Plenty candy. I disagree, because:
A. Licorice is awesome, and
B. It's only like 10% of the overall candy

So Reddit, please let me know. AITA?"
349	282	adjudicated	YTA	I (16 f) asked my mom if I could go trick or treating with some friends shes only met once. She was understandably wary since she doesn’t want to hand me to someone she doesn’t know well and I get that I’d be worried too. The problem is she told me she also doesn’t want to let me go because I’m an “adult” who doesn’t need to go trick or treating anymore and it’s simply adding stress to them who don’t have the time. I started getting mad at that because it’s so convenient for her so call me an adult or child depending on the situation and I just hate being called an adult because it gives extra responsibilities but no pay off like getting to go anywhere I want or having sex (I don’t want to have sex it’s just an example) the worst part is I never follow through with these responsibilities so I’m just a failure. I’m also mad that she’s said she doesn’t have any time I know it’s half true but it’s just this one time of the year and the things she’s busy with aren’t even important she just likes deep cleaning the house when it’s already clean enough. She told me that I already get to go to family parties all the time so I don’t need to go but I still think Halloween is really important since it’s one of the main damn holiday’s that only happens once a year. I get that she’s works a lot and should take a break but she helicopter parents me so much I need either freedom to go to places or for her to have the time. I can also ask my dad which I think I will but the thing is while we don’t hate each other we both neglect each other a lot and our only conversations are either hello how was work or him yelling at us where something is or to do something. He’s not a bad father though I do think he loves us we just don’t have a good relationship. Am I being a spoiled brat right now or am I kinda right? Sorry if I have to much info and thank you for reading this!!
272	246	adjudicated	NAH	Hi I'm (26m) bi and I've recently moved to a new job, the group of guys I work with are all lad types making jokes and the like, I haven't come out to them and nor do I feel like it's necessary for me too. But sometimes there jokes on certain subjects I feel can be quite insensitive and wrong. As someone from the LGBT community I know first hand the damage these jokes can do. But I feel I risk outing myself if I start speaking up and saying something about them. I will say I'm quite a straight acting guy. The jokes don't really bother me but if someone overheard I can imagine them being quite upset by what's being said. So do I say something or just leave them too it.
454	456	adjudicated	YTA	"I am not sure if this qualifies as a AITA sub post. If it doesn’t please remove 

Earlier tonight we had dinner an at Italian restaurant in our area. My family and my wife’s friends family went together. We have a two year old and they have a three and half year old. Both of them threw occasional tantrums, banging on the dinner table, random naughty screams for no reason etc… the restaurant was pretty busy and the guests besides our table were pretty annoyed by our children’s behavior. It isn’t unfair of them because just like us they have come there to enjoy their Friday evening and eat in peace. 

Our waiter was very courteous and we kept apologizing for our little ones behavior. She asked us not to worry. 

When we were almost finished, the lady at the other table made a comment to us that we should not go to restaurants at busy hours. She said people with little kids should come later in the night when things are less busy. It wasn’t a light hearted or funny comment. She went full on and was rude. My friend immediately retorted saying we will come whenever we are hungry. 
I just said, yeah. 

Minutes before this we were talking about apologizing to that table for our kids. But, then this happened.

Are we the assholes for doubling down and ruining their night?

Edit: I agree we were TA. I want to add that my kid has never behaved like this before. The buddying up with other kid brought out a new persona which was quite surprising to us. Ours just sits on the high chair, plays with crayons and then eats. It was a quite a lesson today and we for sure ruined dinner for a few people. I ain’t going on busy nights anymore for sometime. Pizza at home it is for some time."
427	34	adjudicated	NAH	"I (33m) have noticed in the past month that my GF (29f) hasn’t been eating as much as she normally does. We have been together for 4 years now and while she has never had the best appetite it has never been at the level it is at now. 

For context she rarely eats breakfast and the times that she does it means she doesn’t eat lunch, but she has always had lunch and dinner. I normally give us the same portions for dinner and then if she has any leftovers I will eat them (she gives me her plate I don’t just take them) but it’s never a huge amount.

The last few weeks I have only seen her have lunch once and that was the one day she didn’t eat any dinner. We were staying with my family due to renovations at our place and my mom kept mentioning to her that she wasn’t eating lunch. My mom is a bit overprotective at times and was concerned for her health but my GF had a virus at the same time (this came after the appetite left her) so put it down to illness and it was left at that.

We are back home now and she has recovered from the flu but I’m lucky if I can even get her to eat a full meal a day. Today when I noticed she had only eaten a small bag of chips I told her that this couldn’t keep happening and that if she wanted to be healthy she had to eat at least two meals a day, which resulted in an argument in which she claimed I was acting like a parent and monitoring her diet.

I probably could have come at it from a better angle but it’s been making me think as she is an adult should I have even brought it up?

So AITA for making this into a big deal?"
109	132	adjudicated	NAH	"For context my sister lives in Wisconsin. Her friend lives in Kentucky and they are both in their mid twenties. They have plans to go to a concert together in Chicago, with my sister's friend apparently driving from Kentucky to Wisconsin (8+ hour drive), then with my sister go to Chicago to the concert the next day (another 2+ hours), they will stay overnight in a hotel. Then go back to Wisconsin to drop my sister off because they are going with her friend's car (another 2+ hours), then her friend will go all the way back to Kentucky. 

Is it me or does it seem very unrealistic that her friend will actually go through with this? Chicago is literally on the way from Kentucky to Wisconsin, so why would her friend drive all the way to WI first, then Chicago, then WI, then Kentucky again? I brought up my concerns to my sister that it seems very unrealistic and that I'm afraid her friend will bail, but for some reason she is insistent this is legit and her friend is actually going to be doing this. 

I don't know the exact time frame but my sister has work next week Monday so it seems they are literally trying to fit all of this in one weekend. How? And AITA for bringing up my concerns to my sister? She just gets mad at me for even bringing it up."
267	97	adjudicated	TTA	"I have been going through some issues and it got to a point where I literally broke down and couldn’t even talk to anyone. I deleted my social media accounts and told my friends about having issues (no details) and they all were very supportive, and they have been keeping me updated to everything I’m missing out on as a form of keeping in touch.
I woke up today and one of my friends texted me that she’s mad I’m not texting her, even though she knows I am not in a good place right now. And I feel very angry and I think my heart is clouded right now. She stood me up for a week, she would tell me to talk or meet up or something and then last minute or the next day she would apologize and tell me that she couldn’t which is annoying when done frequently. I am not trying to get back at her but I genuinely needed some time off everything but now she’s making me feel guilty. So AITA for not texting her?"
244	380	adjudicated	TTA	"CONTEXT: I lived away from home for four years and grew more emotionally mature and compassionate for social issues etc. This year due to health problems I had to return to my parents home (26f). All of us kids are ND and since I’ve been home, I’ve tried to help my younger siblings (13m & 11f) learn how to healthily deal with their emotions, communicate better with each other, and to be a bit more compassionate to the plights of other humans. This causes a lot of tension with my mum and results in a lot of arguments who doesn’t care about the way our lives are affected everyday by unseen ND symptoms and gets frustrated easily anytime I talk about social issues.

EVENT: Tonight my sister braided her hair into multiple small braids and sat down for dinner. I gently asked her if she was going to school with them and mentioned for future hairstyles to be mindful of cultural appropriateness. Mum instantly got annoyed at me asking why I brought it up saying that her sister wore multiple braids all the time and it was fine and no one cared to which I replied that was in the 80s and society has changed and even though it might not be a big issue in my regional town, it’s an issue happening elsewhere and it’s important to talk about it whether it applies right now or not. I told my sister she wasn’t doing anything wrong but to just be mindful. Mum began a rant at me that it doesn’t affect anyone inside this house, that I constantly get offended at everything and that I always bring up these issues. Dad then chimes in saying I constantly cause arguments. Up until this point I had been calm with my point of view. I suddenly blew up (I NEVER get angry, I pride myself on my patience) and was just done with the constant criticism, that I shouldn’t care for these kind of issues, that my time away has changed me and I’m sick of these being seen as negatives. My last words yelled to them before walking away was “what is so wrong with wanting to be a good human”. 

TLDR: Am I the asshole for trying to educate my family on social issues? My siblings are understanding, my parents are sick of it.

EDIT: my sister explained she was doing the hairstyle to make her curls curlier and the nonexistent issue was resolved. My question is on the bigger picture if I’m the asshole for just bringing up these topics at home? They aren’t brought up because of my family’s actions it’s just conversation."
132	470	adjudicated	NAH	"I have a bit of a conundrum here and was hoping to get some advice from Reddit. For a bit of context, my girlfriend and I have been together for around 4 years and haven’t spent Christmas together yet. We both have fairly high paying jobs and make around the same amount of money. I have family flying into our city to see us before she leaves for Christmas with her family and the plan was to do a Christmas gift exchange at that time. The topic came up around presents and I let her know that she would likely be receiving something from the various members of my family and she may want to think about getting something small for them so she has something to give back in return. She then essentially asked me to put both her and my name on all of the gifts I would be giving my family without contributing anything. I told her that typically if a gift comes from two people that means that both of them paid for it, which led to an overall argument.

Her reasoning is that since her family does it differently than mine, she doesn’t want to participate in that type of gift exchange (her family typically does a secret Santa) rather than everyone getting eachother something. That being said I have offered to help pay for her secret Santa gift if she assists with the gifts for my family. Am I the asshole if I don’t wind up putting her name on my Christmas gifts if she isn’t helping to pick them out or contribute financially?"
58	204	adjudicated	NAH	"It’s a long one. But a few years ago I (33m) was trying to get clean and found myself in between jobs and houses. After lots of couch surfing and moving back into my mothers place I bit the bullet and put a post up on my socials seeing if there was anyone that had a room to rent etc.
The only person to actually reply was a person  (25f) I didn’t really know at all. We would chat here and there on insta but that was it. She said she had been looking to rent a room out at her place so after I met her in person I wound up leasing a room at her rental on the other side of the city. Each week I would send her my half of the rent and she would forward mine and her share onto the landlord, along with me having paid 2 weeks ahead in rent and another 4 weeks for bond before I moved in. 
Fast forward a few months and I’ve been put on the rental lease, found a good job close to home and  everything was going great. Fast forward another 2 or 3 months and my housemate started to show signs of poor mental health and mental illness and was dealing with an unhealthy relationship that she vented to me on a couple of occasions about which raised suspicions that she was using drugs (meth particularly) and noticed she was taking sick days off work more frequently and wasn’t her usual self. One night, we were talking and she admitted we were a week behind on rent, even though I had sent her my portion of it each week she had spent it on meth, but she promised she was on top of it and nothing to worry about.
Fast forward another 4 weeks and I get a call from the landlord informing me my housemate hadn’t been paid the rent for about 7 weeks. So I then arranged to pay him directly each week moving forward. I ended up paying both of our halves of the rent for the remainder of the lease which came to $1655 that I had covered in rent and utilities. 
She ended moving out to her mothers place and I took the lease over. Because she no longer had a car I knew she would have trouble taking all her furniture and clothes and stuff so said she could keep it all in one of the spare rooms here until she had a way to take it and a place to store it all safely. This was around October 2022. It’s now been 12 months and she hasn’t paid any of what she owes me (which I wasn’t holding my breath for anyway tbh) and she hasn’t taken any of her stuff apart from a few bags of clothing here and there. The fact that she helped me out when I was in a pretty desperate situation and gave me a place to live hasn’t been forgotten and I can see how hard things have been for her, but I’m feel like I’m being taken advantage of and treated like dumb cunt. So I’ve decided to give her until December 1 to come and grab all her things or it’s going to be put in landfill, but I don’t know if I’m being a bit harsh or am I justified? 
Feel free to ask for more details about any of it and any advice is very welcome"
3	155	adjudicated	NAH	"My daughter, Rachel 17, has always been a track star. She does not want to do track this year, her junior year. She says it gives her too much anxiety and she doesn’t like the head coach. 

My husband is devastated by her decision, and I feel like that is putting even more pressure and pushing her to not do track. He has told her that this is the year for the team to win state. 

Positives: last year at state, her relay team set a school record. She set a personal best in her best race but failed to make the finals by half a second (400m). She is a wonderful, supportive teammate and all of the other athletes love her being there. She makes cheer sections and makes sure to tell them good job. 

Negatives: she was helping a special needs child clean up following nutrition class which made her a couple minutes late to practice. The coach called her out in front of everyone. His son and another student were even more late from the same class and nothing was said. 

When they practiced blocks, she was called out repeatedly. (I thought constructive criticism that she needs to learn to take?) 

At a meet, her stomach was hurting so she asked to scratch an event (many of the boys had been scratching various events at various meets and while the coach did seem annoyed, nothing was ever said to them). The jumping coach told her to false start and said yeah idk why he treats you like that and that she always hated coaches like him (idk if this played into my daughter’s decision or not).

At state, the coach didn’t know that her relay team made a school record or that another girl made it to finals for her event. 

She ran on the sprint relay at state even though she is not really a sprinter, but the coach kept reminding her that if they lose it would be her fault. 

There will be social fallout for not running when this is the year that they have the best chance to win state as a team. I told my daughter that she needs to be prepared for that. 

Lastly, from the first day of track to last day, she has diarrhea every day at lunch. We talked to the dr about this who wanted food sensitivity tests done. Milk was an issue but even removed, anxiety does seem to be the reason. We have her in counseling. He told her that it’s ok to not do track but she needs to find another passion. They talked about thrift stores and fashion as a new outlet. 

I have told my husband that it is her life and her decision and while she might regret it, she will have to live with that. But, I do actually feel like she is making a mistake even though I keep trying to keep a brave front on.  

So WIBTA or AITA for pressuring my daughter to do track?"
489	466	adjudicated	NAH	"My husband (54M) and I (54F) have two sons, Leighton (13M) and Weston (11M). My father (92M) has been living with us for the past year as his dementia has been getting worse. 
  

  
Over the past 3 months, my father has been increasingly referring to Leighton as “Russell”. Russell was my father’s brother. I never met Russell, as he and a friend, James, along with James’s parents, died in a car crash in 1956 when Russell and James were 15. My great-grandparents were wealthy enough to have color photos of the family back then. I’ve seen photos of Russell, and I will say Leighton looks like he could be his great uncle’s twin.
  

  
My kids have been asking who Russell is, and I’ve just told them he was my uncle who died young. When they ask for more details, I just tell them I don’t know much about him and that my father/their grandpa was not in a state to talk about him.
  

  
My father never talked about Russell to the grandkids, and when I was a kid, rarely brought him up. About 8 years ago, my father and I were in the bedroom and were talking about gay marriage due to news around it. That’s when he told me he had a secret he wanted to tell me. He told me that when Russell and James were 13, his family had caught the boys acting romantically. After that, Russell was scolded by the family for his homosexuality. He told me the only reason they let the boys remain friends is they didn’t want this information to be public. He told me Russell was always “effeminate” and how his family would mock him for that. My father admitted he participated in the mocking and how he regretted it later in life. He said Russell would cry over this often, and looking back later in life made him (dad) feel terrible.
  

  
Last week, I was at the doctor’s office with Leighton for a minor injury he had from baseball when I got a call from Weston’s teacher that he had been saying some homophobic things in class. She explained he was using the f slur, “gay” as an insult and mocking a boy for being “fruity”. In the car after we left, Leighton told me he’s heard some of the kids in his grade from the robotics club (which Weston is in) use that language. 
  

  
After I picked up Weston from detention, Leighton and I tried talking to him and telling him to stop, he said it wasn’t that big of a deal. I had my husband/his dad talk to him, but Weston ignored him too.
  

  
I then decided to sit both of the boys down, I got photos of Russell and explained his story. How badly the family treated him, my father telling him the story of how Russell would cry in his bed. 
  

  
The boys just sat there, I don’t know how it affected them, but I hope it left an impact. 
  

  
Later that night, I was talking to my older sister (58F) about this, her kids are in their mid 20s. She told me that I shouldn’t have told them about Russell, or at the very least, waited until dad died and I was not considerate of him. She also said they weren’t old enough and it was too dark of a thing for them to know. AITA?"
436	264	adjudicated	NAH	"My  brother (two years younger) and I were close growing up probably because we were both severely abused. Our mother beat us and let random people beat us and worse. When I escaped the abuse, I went hardcore into improving myself, probably too much (working on it through therapy). He, unfortunately, has made some hard life choices gotten into drugs and such. I think he’s been drug free for sometime now though. We haven’t seen each other in 10 years. He lives a few states away. 

I have recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. I told him about it during our Thanksgiving call. He expresses sympathy and says he’d like to see me. I tell him we should see each other again but I really don’t know what treatment for my cancer is going to look like yet so maybe after I get better. Since then, I have had a port placed in preparation for chemo that is referred to by many as “the red devil” on Monday. I’m doing more frequent infusions because my doctor believes my cancer is very aggressive. It’s a very stressful and scary time in my life.

Tonight my brother sent me a text with a picture of a train ticket to my hometown to stay for 4 nights right before Christmas. I was shocked. He never even talked to me about it, just bought a ticket to stay with me during the most difficult time in my life. I told him I really can’t have any visitors at that time because of the chemo and I told him I was really not happy that he’d buy tickets to visit me without talking to me first. 

So AITA for not letting my brother stay with me in the middle of “red devil” chemotherapy? I feel guilty because I haven’t seen him in so long but I’m worried about two things. First of course is my immune system, he may be exposed to so many random pathogens on a 20hr train trip. Secondly, I worry about reliving childhood trauma if I see him at a time when I’m so low. I already have flashbacks from things that happened to me as a kid 30 years ago. I fear that seeing him again will worsen those symptoms at a very vulnerable time in my life."
479	149	adjudicated	TTA	"Firstly, my friends and I are all around 23-25, with no kids, younger siblings or any future thoughts of kids. In fact, we have often joked about none of us wanting kids, saying things like “reason number so-and-so” when we see kids being a bit obnoxious in the wild. I personally do not find kids to be fun to be around, I am an awkward person usually and that amplifies when I’m around kids, find it very hard to talk to them.

We have had this activity planned out for a few weeks, I won’t get into too much detail about what it is, but it’s a scavenger type thing located all throughout our city. It’s advertised towards adults and families, though all the promotional photos I saw were of adults.

My friend, I’ll call her Mia, had agreed to let her friend’s 10 year old son join us, without consulting us. I have not met the child, and neither have a couple of our other friends. She told us the night before. Her sister, also a friend, immediately told her not to bring him, as she didn’t want us to be burdened with having to babysit him on what was supposed to be a fun day for us. Mia responded saying that she can’t take it back now, it’s too late and she won’t now hurt him by changing her mind. I understand this, and realize that it would probably hurt him to say no, but we did not agree to have a child join us. The scavenger hunt includes clues to be solved that will lead us to our next location, I’m not sure how difficult they are, but I can imagine that she won’t want us to solve any of them before the kid does, completely ruining the fun around the game for the rest of us. If she had mentioned bringing him earlier, I would have reconsidered going altogether, but now it’s too late as we have our names registered on our ticket.

Personally, I was hoping to make it into a bit of a pub crawl, by having a drink at each place we were sent to, though I hadn’t brought this idea up to anyone yet. Obviously, we can’t do this now as it’s not really appropriate for us to do that around him. 

After Mia continually defended her decision to bring the boy in the group chat, I messaged her privately about the situation and explained that I wasn’t interested in spending my weekend with a child, especially because my free time is limited and my weekends are spent doing the things that I enjoy doing. I felt the message was firm yet kind, I added ❤️❤️❤️ and made sure to explain that I appreciate that she is personally close with the boy, but I think his presence would put a damper on our day. She responded saying that she was sorry that I felt this way but she wasn’t changing her mind, she also mentioned that we would be kind of paired up (others were bringing their partners and I had invited a friend that Mia was also friends with, though I am closer to) and implied that we would be excluding her and that’s why she wanted to bring the kid.

62	323	adjudicated	TTA	Hello AITA community, I'm in a bit of a bind and need some outside perspective. My fiancé(28f) and I(29m) have been planning our wedding for over a year, and it's set for next month. We've put in a lot of effort and money, and everything is finally coming together. But here's where it gets complicated. My sister, who I'm very close to, just won an all-expenses-paid trip to  Europe. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for her, but the dates clash with my wedding. She asked me to postpone the wedding so she can attend both events. I told her I can't change the date because of our non-refundable bookings and guests who have already made travel plans. My sister got upset, saying I'm being inflexible and not considering her feelings.My parents think I should try to accommodate her, but my fiancé and friends say we shouldn't have to change our plans. I'm torn because I want her there, but changing the date seems almost impossible at this stage.So, Reddit, AITA?
343	378	adjudicated	TTA	A little back story, so I divorced my ex wife about 2 yrs ago and I was granted full custody of both of our kids. She was granted visitation every Saturday and to pay $100 for child support🙄. So in the 2 years, she’s showed up to 4 visitations and paid zero child support. She has told everyone we know a sob story that I don’t let her see the kids, which is a lie, as she has court order set dates. And that I know that she doesn’t have money and being forced to pay child support, even though I have never asked her to pay anything, cause I am good financially. She stopped calling and texting our kids about 4 months ago. Disappeared, her mom, who calls our kids daily told me that she’s traveling, weird cause she’s broke, and finding herself. Today she calls out of nowhere and says “I will be there in 15 minutes to see the kids”. I was like “no you can’t. First it isn’t your day, second, you haven’t communicated with the kids in 4 months and third, you have people with you and I don’t want strangers here”. She responds “I am showing up anyways, I don’t care what you say, I am going to see my kids now” and hangs up. I then told the kids “c’mon kids, lets go get ice cream” and leave. Well, she called sobbing and basically had everyone on social media attacking me, saying how I was weaponizing our kids against her, and that I am a rotten person and what not. I felt like I wasn’t out of line, but many seem to think I was🤷🏽‍♂️ Am I an Ahole🤔
12	406	adjudicated	NAH	"My boyfriend of more than two years and I have decided to really test how we are together when we live together. Unfortunately, he shares the house with his mom (they have separate floors for each other). My boyfriend has half ownership of the house.
I will stay with him for a very limited time (less than two months), wherein we can see how and what do we think of each other under the same roof. I wanna spend the time with my boyfriend majorly so we can be closer together.

One time, boyfriend and I got into a misunderstanding and I wasn't in the mood to socialize. That same time also, her mother invited some people in the neighbourhood. I was not in the right mind space to do some socializing with neighbors I don't know that time and instead of forcing myself, I just stayed in the room and didn't get  out. That night, I heard his mother stomped the stairs so loud, and my guess was that stomp was for me, and the next morning, it was confirmed that she got mad and disappointed with me cause of that. We talked it off.

Now, my boyfriend and I have plans of travelling the nearby countries on weekends, this time, his mom wants to meet me her brothers on the weekend. 

Also, 2 days before my departure from my boyfriend's place, she wants me to go with them to her ex husband's early birthday celebration. Though my boyfriend mentioned that we have plans, she goes with saying that his father would be very sad. 

At first I thought I was unreasonable for thinking his mom is not being considerate and being pushy,, but now I do think she is. AITA for thinking so?"

When we got there it was really unhygienic like the guy wasnt even wearing gloves or anything so I refused to eat it cause well who knows were his hands have been.

This cause my wife to be mad at me for being to ""posh"" and refusing to eat something cause the guy wasnt wearing any gloves which she claims is perfectly normal. She brought up a couple other times I refused to do things with her cause they weren't upto my normal standards. However I think I was correct in this specific scenario cause well Im not eating food that some stranger without gloves or running water cooked.

So aita"
181	195	adjudicated	NAH	"First, english is not my  first language, sorry about any mistakes. Second, throwaway because I do not want any association with this in my personal account.

The story:

My estranged father passed away three months ago. I was contacted as the closet relative, and after I contacted my aunt, my fathers sister, which I did not have contact to either. 

There was a 'formal' meeting the day after, which traditionally is where you see the departed, and a undertaker is selected. I went, with my mother (for moral support) and my aunt also came (I said if she wanted to she could). 

When it came to select the undertaker, I said I would not select one, since

1. I honestly did not care. ( did not say it with these exact words) 

2. Did not want to risk being stuck with the bill, if he had left no money to cover it.

My aunt got mad, and decided she would be selecting one which was fine by me. 
It turned out that my father had some money and the official things (the funeral) was paid before I got my inheritance. 

The problem is the money did not cover the memorial gathering that my aunt decided to hold after the funeral. 

Now my aunt insist that I reimburse her. She apparently though that would be covered before I got the inheritance, and knew that he had some money/valueable stuff. I was not present at the funeral or the gathering after, and I had made it clear that I did not want for anything to be planned. 

The inheritance could pay for the gathering but not much would be left, and I honestly would rather pay for the therapy debt which my father is the reason I have. 
So, AITA?"
281	223	adjudicated	INFO	"I am one of a handful of bridesmaids for a wedding next week. Throughout this whole process the bride has been using all of us like wedding planners; demanding we help with planning her cake, her seating arrangement, finding a dj, booking the venue etc. We have explained to her that those are decisions her and the groom need to make, and we are not her wedding planners. We have physically created and made every single decoration, invite etc by hand, which thats fine. But her other demands are just odd and she's very disorganized. She frequently asks for money or for us to buy things for her as well. She didn't have a dress till this week for example. 

 The Bachelorette party was a nightmare. I was left out of the loop with dinner plans so wasn't able to get off work to make dinner, just the party. When I asked why I wasn't included in this conversation everyone said oh we thought the bride told you separately.

I just booked the hotel and was touching base with the MOH who planned to let me carpool with them into the mountains. We had originally planned to leave the night before right after I got off work. Upon texting her and double checking if she wants gas money etc, im told, again, that I was left out of a conversation and plans changed. Now all of a sudden her rehearsal dinner is at noon that day. I was completely left out of this loop again with the same excuse of oh we thought she told you separately. The drive is a few hours long, and  don't get off work till 5:30. I am unable to drive as my car needs work and won't make that trip.I no longer have transportation up their either. Her solution was to take an uber, which that time of day and distance is 200-400 dollars;definitely not in my budget.

AITA if I decide to not go to the wedding? Clearly I'm not vital enough to keep in the loop so I do not think I will be missed."

424	419	adjudicated	NAH	"I've (21F) been friends with Matthew (22M) for the past 3 years. We have been getting to know each other more in the past 2 months. He agreed to take things slow since I was in my final year and he had just graduated. He's taken a gap year to help out in his father's company and lives about 30 mins away.

We video call often, but when things get busy we only text. He hadn't texted me all day last Friday, not even a 'happy birthday', but I didn't really think about it at the time from the lack of sleep from assignments due this week.

By the time my presentation ended around 2pm, I texted 3 of my close friends in our group chat that I was going to take a nap because of a headache and that I had an alarm set for 6, an hour before our usual dinner time. They knew I have headaches often and am on meds for it.

I woke up about 5-10mins before my alarm to over 10+ miss calls from Matthew and the 3 each. The headache wasn't all gone despite the meds, so I texted asking what was going on. They left me on read, but Matthew replied asking me to head down to pick something up he'd sent to the security guard's office. I tried calling, but he declined the call so I told him about my condition and asked if it was urgent.

He continued being evasive so I went out, but he scared the living shit out of me by yelling 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY' in my face the moment I opened my door. I was too shocked to respond, the first thing I said was ""how did you get up here?"" - security must have recognised him and let him through.

I was rushed to get ready in 5mins and off to dinner ""for just the two of us"". Assuming it really was just us, I asked if we could take 5 more mins in the car to rest before getting off. He was reluctant, but agreed.

Well, everyone was there - except we were early, and not everyone had arrived.

Dinner went well anyhow, I enjoyed the company despite being unwell and genuinely appreciated everyone taking time out of their busy schedules.

Right before dropping me off that night, he hit me with a curve ball and asked if we could become official. I'd expressed in the past that given the choice, I didn't like having meaningful days clash. I hesitated so much, he took it back. Things got awkward, and I eventually thanked him for planning the night and left because the headache was proper unbearable.

Since then, he's texted me saying how his feelings are hurt because I was't surprised. We got into an argument over the weekend after he said the least I could do was ""pretend to care"". Now my close friends have also been saying that I'm ungrateful, that I'm the asshole for not being lenient to him since this is his first relationship. We have so many mutual friends and no one's taking my side either. AITA?

249	167	adjudicated	NAH	"I (27f) have been with my partner (27m) for about a year and a half now. We're an interracial couple - he's Indian and I'm white - and while I knew this was going to present it's own unique problems, I had hoped my parents would be accepting of our relationship. They don't disapprove of him - they actually get along rather well. But they're older - mid 60s - and I think anyone who has boomer parents knows exactly where I'm going with this.

They makes racist jokes a lot. My mom told me to be careful that he doesn't make me come back to India with him and used the term ""fucking dotheads."" My dad isn't much better. When I said how excited my partner was to have my cat come with me to the apartment, my dad went ""Maybe he wants to eat her.""

I didn't take these remarks laying down, but every protest was met with ""We aren't cracking these jokes in front of him, why are you being so sensitive?"" And even a few ""You don't appreciate how hard we work to be accepting of your relationship, give us a break.""

So I pulled out the big guns.

Christmas is a big deal to my family, always has been. I have a huge extended family, and Christmas time is the only time we can all gather together and catch up. Christmas Eve is usually spent at my aunt's house, where we exchange gifts and get wine drunk, and then Christmas Day is usually spent with the immediate family. This will be my first Christmas where I'm not living with my parents, and my mom made me swear that I would come over Christmas morning. 

So I laid it out for my parents (separately, because at best my dad will let my mom steamroll over my thoughts and feelings and at worst will spin it to make it seems like I'm being inconsiderate and unreasonable.) I said, flat out, ""I don't want to have to do this, but if you keep making racist jokes or keep making excuses for the jokes, [partner] and I won't be over for Christmas morning.""

Dad took it fairly well. He went quiet for a bit before going ""Alright, I'll stop. I was trying to be funny and get a rise out of you, but you're right, that isn't cool of me, I'm sorry.""

Mom took it less well. She started sounding like she was going to cry and said ""You promised you would be there for Christmas morning! You PROMISED. You can't just back out of that!""

I told her that there was a very simple solution. She got angry at me and told me I had to accept her behavior because that's just how she was raised. I stood up and said, ""You're right, I do have to accept your behavior. But I don't have to tolerate it."" Then left.

Later, my dad called to tell me how upset she was and that I didn't really take her feelings into account when I threatened her, and I probably could have been nicer about it because, quote, ""You know your mom doesn't take well to this stuff."" He thinks I took it too far.

So, AITA?"
270	183	adjudicated	NAH	"We live in upper US area where it gets cold and snow can start to come around this time. We are used to harsh winters (close to 0 if not negative in the winter months is usual). This morning we woke to a tiny layer of snow (which will melt when the sun comes up) and temperatures hovering around freezing (32F). Again, not anything crazy out of the ordinary, we've lived here our entire lives so we're used to it. 

Our 10 year olds bus stop system switched last year so instead of stopping at every house, they now have 1 designated spot for pick up for the neighborhood. It's about a 3 minute walk from our home. No roads to cross, she can walk the bike path around the pond.

My husband works as a part time snow plow driver, so he has to leave early on snow days (3am today instead of his usual 8). He normally drives her to the spot on his way to work a couple minutes before the bus gets there. 

I'm a SAHM. We also have a 1 and 4 year old. The 1 year old is normally still asleep during the morning routine, and sleeps for at least an hour afterward. I use that time to get quite a bit of the daily things around the house that need doing done without a baby attached. 

This morning she threw a fit about everything. How cold it was. She didn't want to wear her winter coat. She didn't want to walk. She wanted me to either wake the baby up to put in the car for a 5 minute round trip to drop her off. Or leave him sleeping in the house alone. Neither of those were good options to me. She's 10, she's able to stand outside. Some other kids have an even further walk than she does, and they do it every day. She left in a huff pretty early to the bus getting there refusing to wear gloves or snow pants (but conceded with a sweater, light winter coat, and hat). 

I didn't think I was the AH until I talked to husband later and he said I could've done option 1 and it wouldn't have been that big of a deal. I think I shouldn't have to wake the baby up and disrupt his day. On the super negative or windy days, I will drive her if husband is gone. I thought we'd have a couple more months until then, and 1 year old will be in a different sleep stage, hopefully weened off night bottles by then.

ETA: 
•She gets plenty of attention and isn't neglected. She's the only one in sports, which we both attend and cheer her on. We regularly have 1 on 1 mom/daughter or dad dates with her. She alone always joins me on errands if she wants so we can wander target or get Starbucks and drive around just the two of us.

•She knows she has to walk if dad is gone and it's not crazy cold or rainy conditions. He drops her off as it's the path he takes every day anyway on the way to work. She did it last year. It's just a nice thing he does for her and not in any way an inconvenience to him.

•The 4 year old is special needs so a disability van comes to the house for pick up 15 minutes before she has to leave. She likes to help with that so she knew the weather. She loves being an older sibling. 

•Tantrums aren't usual but also not out of the ordinary lately. We used to say from age 8 she was 8 going on 18. I raised a strong, willful girl who knows her own mind and isn't afraid to speak it (with a preteen attitude angle).

My brother is away this week on business and when he's away, my SIL(30F) gets lonely so what she does is she gets ahold of people and basically tries to have a visitor every night. Tuesday night was my night. I threw on a dress, went to the store, bought wine, and headed over.

About an hour later the wine was gone and she goes, "" Quick question"" then prefaces it as a kinda weird question. She asks why she never sees me wearing pants anymore. I asked her to drop that question. She said it was pure curiosity. I told her to drop the curiosity, move on. She asked why I was getting defensive. I finally cracked and asked her to take a wild guess why she doesn't see me in pants. She goes, "" Do they not fit?"" I said she'd guessed right. She gasped, said that should be my wakeup call. I told her I was done with this talk. She said she wasn't done and told me to grasp the gravity of being so fat none of my 7 pants fit. I told her not call me fat as it's unhelpful. She asked if my pants were all "" These almost fit"" or were they all "" No way in hell will these button""? I told her that was a rude question, told her she was being a bitch and left. She told me she wasn't a bitch but someone trying to help. I left her place.

283	219	adjudicated	TTA	"Backstory: My (36m) ex-wife (36f) and I were elementary sweethearts. We got married in our late 20s. We had infertility issues for years and had to go through IVF. We were both ecstatic and loved our baby girl very much.

A year after giving birth, she decided to cheat again (total of 3 times) and I forgave her for all incidents. She eventually decided to divorce me due to the advice from her trusty “friend/sister” who was also cheating on her husband when our divorce happened. 

Fast forward, immediately after we finalized the divorce, she and the guy (Colombian) she was cheating with moved in together. Our daughter was 2yo at the time. She’s extremely attached to me and I treasure every second I have with her—more so because of the infertility issues her mother and I had to go through to have her. We both understood that our daughter was attached to me, so she refused to do any “FaceTime” because it would make it hard for our daughter to transition. I accepted this even though it was extremely difficult—my only focus is my daughter’s happiness.

My ex and the guy eventually have their own child together on top of his other kids from the other mother. He is originally from Colombia and they plan to take a trip there in December.

My ex knew I would never agreed to my little girl (now 5yo) to going, so she said I could FaceTime our daughter everyday during the trip. I was hesitant and leaned towards “No,” but at the end of the day I just want my ex to be happy so I researched the country and even spoke to people from that region and they advised me to take extra precautions. 

I agreed to let her take our little girl to Colombia under the circumstances: she provide me a copy of the guy’s driver’s license in case of the worst situation—considering it’s Colombia (known for narcotics distribution, kidnapping, and civil unrest among other things). My ex is Caucasian and my girl is mix, but she looks very much like Caucasian.

Ex says they’re only visiting areas that are safe and away from the areas that are listed on the government website as “Do not visit”. I’m concerned for my little girl’s safety. She says all the information I need about her Colombian boyfriend will be left with her mother. I just don’t want to be dealing with the mother if sh*t happens while they’re there…

Any advice would be great. Also, AITAH for requesting that information (for worst case scenario)?"

I noticed who it was right away but messaged him back by saying hi, basically what he said it that he recently broke up with his girlfriend and he was looking for a one night stand. My 18yr old self saw this hot man and instantly agreed. i don't wanna get too much into it but we did it in a walmart parking in his red truck.. and it was the best thing ever and exactly what i imagined from a guy this tall, and let me say he knew what he was doing. he came twice and he basically threw my out of his car after he used me. my shirt still in his car as he drove away, i got in my car and drove to my house where me, my parents, and my brother live. I figured that my brother and X stopped talking as he hasn't been over in a long time, and this was not usual for him. but as sunday rolled around my family was having people over to watch football and i thought nothing of it. but i saw the same red truck X had driven to the walmart parking lot a few days before. as i see him walk to the house i see a girl get out of his car and ¡ immediately recognized her as X's gf of almost 2 years. i run up to my room and i think about what happened, i hear X greet the people at the door and i hear his girlfriend talk to my mom and X talking to my brother. i come downstairs and X looks at me and then he look at his girlfriend, he start to panic seeing me. i was also becoming extremely nervous about seeing him and ran back into my room. i hear footsteps coming upstairs and i see X looking at me as i sit in my bed panicking, he tell a me that he had fun and i look at him and tell him that he cheated. he says that he really didn't care and he says he would do it all again. his concern left his body and he told me he wanted to do it again.. and that i had done something his girlfriend couldn't. and after hear this i couldn't help myself, we had sex for the second time but this time on my bed. he put his hand over my mouth and made sure that i wasn't being loud, and this made the experience even more exciting. i couldn't believe this was real and it honestly felt like a dream. it's been a month since then and we only hook up one more time at the c walmart as before. it's almost 12:30 and he messaged V at 12 asking if we could do it again. someone help me..

163	29	adjudicated	YTA	"So a bit of background: last week my mom’s boyfriend yelled at her in front of his family during Sunday dinner. She was tired and didn’t want to immediately help him prep and he took this as her having a bad attitude. A tiff broke out and eventually he started dropping f bombs before yelling that he was “sick of her shit” in front of his dad and brother. This made her feel very sad and ashamed. The past few days have consisted of him ignoring her and her going to bed early.

Today I went to her house to visit like normal and asked her how things were with him. She explained that he was still refusing to make even small talk. She also had a bad day because she went to the doctor and found out she had shingles. To put it mildly I was pissed. This isn’t the first time he’s blown up on her. So when he came home early and started showing her memes on his phone and rubbing her back like nothing had happened, I snapped. She seemed to be relieved he wasn’t upset anymore but I didn’t care. I went into baby bear mode and after he tried joking with me a few times, I told him to fuck off and not talk to me until he’d apologized to my mom. I really let him have it. But he was confused bc he’d already forgotten about the incident. That was not a good enough excuse. I told him to be a man and say sorry until my mom ushered me outside and politely told me to leave.

I feel like I shouldn’t have talked to an older adult that way nor spoken for her instead of letting her guide the situation, but I’m really sick of this dude. AITA? They also usually go out on Thursdays, so I feel like I ruined her date night in addition to her getting shingles. Let me know! Cheers"
106	301	adjudicated	YTA	So I had a crush on this guy at school. It was a simple hallway crush I barley saw him and I would never talk to him. My friend told him I liked him and apparently he liked me back. We kept it at this mutual pinning level for a month and then he added me on Snapchat. I talked to him but he never came up to me at school. I’m really shy around people I never talk to. I told him this but he expected me to every thing ‘coupley’. I would try having a normal conversation with him and all he would do is ask if I could talk to him at school or call him first. At one point I even told him can you call me first. Or sometimes if I was busy flat out told him I’m busy but he wouldn’t care and think I was using my shyness or the fact I have a life to ignore him. I have a friend and she rooted for us the hole time. When I opened up about these problem she defended him and told me I’m thinking to much into it. It was my birthday and he told me he likes me. I tell him I like you to and he then he hits me with the do you want to date. I cant say no to people since I’m scared that’s gonna ruin any reputation I have whatsoever  so I ask my friend and she pure pressures me into dating him. I tel her multiple times that i want to but she doesn’t really care. Through the whole month of us dating it was summer and my mom and stepdad took me out everywhere and I didn’t go on my phone a lot so this would cause me to ignore him in some way. I would get home and get on my phone immediately to tell him I’m sorry and I went out he didn’t like this becuase he would always go “okay… just try to answer me next time” and I would still be madly in love. I started to “ignore”his text more becuase i was staying with my mom and tried being off my phone as much as possible. My friend thought I was bitching but I didn’t really care becuase hey boyfriend was just getting madder and madder at me the more I went out and couldn’t say goodmorning and answer the could we call tonight every morning. Then he broke up with me I didn’t really notice becuase I was liteallry farming non tears of Themis for the anniversary but I went on Snapchat and see my friend soaking me she tells me I’m Terriable and made him feel Terriable and I’m a HORRIABLE person and that I should’ve answered him. I DIDNT get why she cares so much but apparently she really liked him. It turns out that he was tlaki to other girls the whole time and was actually being reminded to talk me while I was always thinking about him and wondering if I had sniffing one to answer him when I got home. Now him and that best friend I was talking about are dating. And also he had been bad mouthing me the whole  time and saying I made the relationship go Ina downfall and sent him to therapy.

Long story short we said we were only going to see each other but he slowly stopped texting me and calling ( we were LD ) I expressed my concern and he said  it’s my fault I feel like that and that he can’t text me all the time because he has other priorities. The next day he was posting a girl on his stories saying she’s the most beautiful view and he loves her. I was really heartbroken because I thought we were going somewhere with this. Now 2 years later He’s been texting me for a couple months saying “ hey “ here and there and asking how I been and he’s sorry for everything “ I’m not responding because I have nothing to say to him and I’m seeing someone else. I part of me feels wrong since they’re apologizing I should respond. Weirdly at the same time I have another “ex” reaching out to me to…..
 
A guy a dated around 6 months ago that was honestly really crappy he’s the only guy that insulted me called me “ crazy and a shittier “ for eventually not talking to him because he was late to every date said he was going to get me flowers and never did etc. He was all talk. I gave him a lot of changes for some reason…
Now he’s been texting me and calling saying “ sorry for how I treated you I miss you and I hope we can talk and come to a reasonable solution. “Part of me Is scared if I don’t respond he will get upset and insult me again putting blame on me for not communicating. Should I at least tell these men I’m seeing someone else or is it okay to never text them again because they messed up and lost access."

when we were out shopping, my boyfriend bought me a bottle of soda. he and i share food and drink all the time, however oftentimes i will buy something for myself, or he will buy something for me, and then he will finish or almost finish it without asking. sometimes i’m disappointed to go enjoy something to find that it’s gone or almost gone. today i found that he had finished most of the soda, and while it wasnt a big deal, i was a tiny bit disappointed because there wasn’t any other soda and the store is closed.

he saw my disappointed look, and the defences immediately came up. “*are you really this pissed off at me about soda?*”

i just informed him that i was a little disappointed and that i wish he had just asked. he exploded at me, cursing and shouting, saying i was making a huge deal over something so trivial as a drink, that he was thirsty and soda was there, that he shouldn’t have to ask because he shares everything with me and that i should do the same (which i do) and then went on to exaggerate and say he’ll take care to label everything that is “mine” from now on so that he knows not to touch it. i tried to tell him it’s about him *not asking*, and he just kept repeating “IT’S SODA.” and “i’m sorry *i guess* for drinking *your* soda??” “i’ll buy you another soda, i’ll buy you *a million* sodas if it’s this important to you”. in response. i told him he’s being a bit of an asshole now and left the room, all while he was still screaming and hollering behind me. i’m now heating up dinner but he’s refusing to eat.

the whole thing turning into an argument is a bit shocking because normally he’d make light of something like this. he’d laugh it off and say something like, ‘yeah, sorry, i was really thirsty, i’ll get you another one tomorrow’. he’s normally very adamant that i voice how i feel no matter how minor. i don’t know why he’s so deeply offended this time.

what do i do here? i feel like bringing it up again to try to come to an understanding is just prolonging and enlarging a tiny issue even more. i just want him to understand it’s not about the soda - the soda is just indicative of the larger issue where he can be a bit inconsiderate. yes, i’m always happy to share with him, and i would expect him to share with me too if i asked - and that’s just *it*. i always ask when it’s something that mainly belongs to him, i don’t just help myself and leave it empty.

And gestured for us to move. There are no assigned seats in our cafeteria and we had been there the entire semester. So I stood my ground and said no.

Started dating close to 3 years ago and around 6-7 months back she’s really started to not take care of herself. 

I should also state that when we first started talking/dating she was very clean always on top of things worked out etc.. that seemed to change very suddenly. Nothing major happened in life like a death of a family member/friend. 


Life as a whole is going well. Both doing very well in our careers nice cars nice home but she doesn’t seem to want to do anything for herself. She’s gained more than “relationship weight” I already know I’m going to catch hate for saying that. Won’t pick up after herself what so ever the house is constantly a wreck because of her. Her clothes are constantly all over the place. I’m the one that always picks them up folds and puts them away almost daily only for her to tear her closet apart again the next morning. When she cooks is exclusively for herself and she absolutely trashes the kitchen only for me to get home and have to clean for an hour before I can make myself something for dinner. With the hours I work I’m not home awake for more than an hour or two  during the week. On the weekends she sits on the couch while I scrub away a weeks worth filth that she’s created. I do all of the laundry all of the dishes the majority of the cooking all of the cleaning all of the yard work snow removal make sure all the bills are paid on time maintain both her car and my truck etc…

I’m somewhat of a neat freak I guess. I like things put back when they’re done being used things organized and so on. I really don’t think this is a lot to ask for. Anytime to this day if I cook or do any projects I never leave a mess because quite honestly it drives me absolutely insane. 

 I’ve brought this up in conversation with her before and not in a argumentative way I tried approaching it as civilly as I possibly could only to be hit with the same “you’re just an asshole” “you don’t care about me”. 

AITA for wanting her to change her ways and take better care of herself?


EDIT: since I keep getting asked about mental health. She has no history of being depressed or anything of that sort. We have talked about it before in depth and she shows no signs outside of what I’ve already stated. She’s still happy has never mentioned anything about it.

399	207	adjudicated	TTA	"My wife and I moved in to our townhouse 5 years ago. As soon as we did, our next door neighbor introduced herself and gave us information on everyone in the neighborhood that we neither asked for or wanted. She is definitely one of those nosy neighbors who looks through the back fence, we've caught her, and talks about everyone! I tend to be friendly but keep to myself. While I like to be aware, I don't need to be in everyone's business so I would cut her off when she began gossiping. My wife isn't a gossip either, but has a more difficult time shutting people down. And to avoid any assumptions, we're both women. 

Over the years this neighbor has started small confrontations with me because I'm ""short"" or ""snippy"" with her. She'll want to talk to me through our shared fence, but I work from home and can't just sit and chit chat all day. Plus, that's just so creepy to me! She even accused our dog of being scary one day, then tried to love on her the next. She's also made some pretty racist comments about workers in the neighborhood who ""don't speak English"" or Black neighbors who ""have all those cars"". She even tried to accuse a Black family of throwing paint at an elderly woman's car. It was bird poop!

Cut to this week. Her landlord had been in contact with us regarding our shared fence because he was replacing his fence and needed our permission to remove and replace the portion we share. We settled everything with him and the workers came today while my wife was out and I was working from home. I get a knock on my door and it's her telling me she stopped the crew from touching our fence because the crew that doesn't speak English was going to tear it down. I was confused because that was the reason we were involved in the process at all. She proceeded to tell me FOUR more times the crew did not speak English. I asked what her landlord told her and she said no one tells her anything, but she knew we had been notified about the work. I then asked if she has google translate on her phone or can call her landlord. I had not been in direct contact with her landlord, but my wife and I discussed it and it was my understanding the shared fence was being replaced. I was short with her because she was being so rude and I had no idea what she was doing at my door in the first place. 15 minutes later the men were taking down the shared fence and she was standing at my back gate overseeing the men!!!

When my wife came home, the neighbor came outside to complain about me being mean as if my wife would side with her. This caused my wife to yell at her to leave me alone and I burst into tears in the house. I feel trapped, but wonder if I should have just coddled this adult woman! AITAH?"

Myself (grandson), and her sons, live in the US. Someone needs to go pick her up and bring her to the US. My dad somehow got the idea that I would go pick her up and do all the logistics, etc. and pay my own flight as well (not cheap, but I'm also better off than he or my uncle is). I feel like this is a ""taking care of your aging parents"" thing, and that he or my uncle should be first. If they absolutely cannot, of course I would go get her. But I feel a bit frustrated that I am forced to say no to my grandmother and make up some excuse, when it should be one of them first trying to go. Thoughts? Am I being unreasonable here?

Relevant info: we rarely fight but this has really hit a sore spot for him. I felt justified in this because we would have been spending almost the entirety of December on vacation together, and overall I always have and always will put him first. I am just needing a bit of time to decompress with some friends before work starts up again in January. 

He is really hurt (I don’t know why because he won’t speak to me) and I can’t wrap my head around whether this hurt is justified, or if he is possibly being over sensitive  and subsequently using silence as a tool to manipulate me. 

Is he wrong in doing this or AITA?

147	222	adjudicated	ESH	"When my spouse and I met, we were a mess. Having a lot of sex, drinking too much, arguing plenty. We ended up getting pregnant after about a year of knowing each other.

As soon as he found out I was pregnant, he stopped touching me. Various reason such as new stress from having to provide, not feeling aroused by a pregnant me, living in too small of a space…

Then baby came, still no intimacy because of breastfeeding, stress of providing, and now because I was too demanding. 

Found a stash of hundreds of nude photos of his exes that he was jacking off to the whole time. I told him how much it hurt me, and he said he would delete them all.

We moved states, away from all my family, and the heavy drinking and berating started. 2 years of that, finding that he didn’t delete the photos of his exes and just sent them to a secret email. Has a secret Instagram account to save photos of his exes and where they were then. Onlyfans of an ex. I was furious this time, throwing his shit away and violating his privacy regularly. No intimacy at all.

I said I was leaving, that we would work something out to be near his son. He begged me to stay, and that’s where the change started. Stopped drinking, started being much more kind, taking work seriously and providing consistently. I stopped going through stuff, stopped nagging, stopped critiquing and behaving emotionally.

2 years later we are healthily communicating, no alcohol, berating, critiquing, criticism. Not even many arguments anymore, we talk things through and are inching our way to financial goals. We get along as a family and support each other, we encourage and speak praises to each other.

It all seems great, but in 2 years we have had sex 4 times. He is regularly watching porn because he admits it is a bad habit and he can’t break it. I try not to take it personally, but I’m growing in disgust for myself. He wants to have another baby, but he thinks I’m demanding to much when I say we need to fix our sex life before another child. He says “aren’t you in it for the long run? Can’t you see how much I have already done and changed, I can get over this too. You need to give me time. What, you’re gonna go find another man because we don’t have sex?”

My dad was in a dead bedroom for 20 years, I watched him go from a valiant, happy, loving family man to a skeleton of himself. He died from overdose the Christmas of my 18th birthday. I don’t think I can commit to a life of no sex, but on the same hand, I don’t want to invite another man in to my life even in the near future. I’m 26… I feel like my time is running out. 

I feel like I’m demanding too much, that I have demanded too much from him. AITA for wanting to repair our intimacy before having another child?"

I’ve been there for almost a year and we’ve grown pretty close. Close enough to where we take all of our breaks/lunches together and we’ll even hang out outside of work. The problem at hand is that she has bedbugs. And I 100% don’t judge her at all for them. I’ve had them before and I know that the cleanest people can get them and that it’s not her fault. But since I’ve had them before I know they’re obnoxiously hard to get rid of and ever since I’ve found out about them I’ve been checking my clothing and other items that she’s been around constantly to see if I can see any. I try to make sure that I’m not obviously doing it because I don’t want to embarrass her but anytime I have a sudden itch after being around her or I discretely check my items I feel guilty for doing it but I just can’t help it.

151	116	adjudicated	NAH	"Diwali is right around the corner, and it's a huge deal in our culture. My wife, whom I've been with for a decade (dated for 8 years, married for 2), absolutely adores this festival. Every year, we head to my hometown to celebrate Diwali at my parents' grand mansion.

This year was no different in terms of excitement. My wife, eager as ever, called up my mom to discuss decoration plans. Coincidentally, on the day she called, my mom had just had a disagreement with my dad. They were split over whether to repaint the mansion this year or the next. The house is massive, and repainting would be a time-consuming affair, a luxury my dad felt he couldn't afford right now. This left my mom a tad disheartened. So, when my wife inquired about the Diwali preparations, my mom, possibly still influenced by her earlier disagreement, mentioned that they weren't planning much. After all, they had decorations from the previous year, like curtains, that were still in pristine condition.

Fast forward a bit, and my enthusiastic wife had already shortlisted and invested time in picking out new decorations to surprise everyone back home. But here's the twist: during a casual call with my mom, she let slip that she'd bought some new decor items, hoping to surprise us. This put me in a dilemma since both were unknowingly planning and spending on similar items. To prevent any further overlap and potential waste, I decided to clarify things. I told my mom about my wife's plans and also informed my wife about my mom's purchases.

This didn't go down well. My wife was upset, feeling her hours of effort in selecting the perfect items might go to waste due to potential mismatches with what my mom bought. My mom, sensing the brewing storm, suggested I not say anything further, and she'd handle it. But my wife echoed the same sentiment. The problem? I'd already spilled the beans to both.

Here's the thing: I've always been a straight shooter. I prefer laying out all the facts, believing it's simpler than holding back information or sharing half-truths. But in doing so, did I complicate matters more? 

This whole decoration debacle is just one example to paint the picture. What I'm really trying to figure out is: Am I the jerk here for always being this upfront? It's not a one-time thing; I often find myself in hot water because folks tell me I don't have a filter or know how to phrase things right. So, am I truly the bad guy for just saying things as they are? AITA for saying things directly?"
357	429	adjudicated	TTA	"I (31 F) and my husband (31 M) have been together for about three years. We love each other, communicate well, and generally have an easy, good relationship.

He and I are wired very differently. I care a lot about political and social causes (I’m a lawyer and was a poly sci major) and he pretty apathetic about social justice and most political issues.  Mostly, we just let the other one be and dont let our differences affect our relationship. Sometimes, our different values surface though. in the time we’ve been together, we have never had a fight about anything except political/social issues.Even though we generally do vote the same, we have very different ideals and approaches to the world. 

Since we got together, I’ve been annoyed that he uses slurs against minority groups, not to their face, but in social interactions or when talking to me. For reference, I am White and Husband is a person of color. However, he uses slurs directed at groups he is not a part of. He always claims it’s no big deal, as long as the people from those groups are not present to hear the slurs. I vehemently disagree with this. I feel like it’s needless and disrespectful to make fun of/disparage any group of people. And I also think that if you wouldn’t say it to their face, you shouldn’t say it behind their back.

Today we had our biggest fight yet. In casual conversation, he used a pretty aggressive slur against a group who has largely been very vocal about not wanting to be called the word he said. 

I told my husband that he was being thoughtless and that words have power. In response, he yelled at me for the first time in  our lives, told me that I should shut up because I’m White, and said that he felt annoyed that a White woman was telling him what he could or couldn’t say.

I get where he is coming from and don’t want to be an out of touch “White savior.” 

However, I don’t feel like being a POC gives you the right to say whatever you want about all other minority groups.

I’ve been spinning my wheels since the fight cause  I don’t know f I’m just being overly sensitive, and I certainly don’t want to speak over him, as he is the POC and  a person I love and respect.

Am I the Asshole for asking him to stop using slurs?"
373	260	adjudicated	TTA	"I (23F) have been living with my grandmother (72f) for a few months whilst I am inbetween houses. I am grateful for that an understand I am under her roof and am as such respectful of her space.

 I am in recovery from an eating disorder that was very severe and I spent several years in inpatient facilities for it so my grandmother is well aware of how serious it was/is.

I am weight restored and doing okay but I am struggling a bit at the moment so I am finding more things triggering than usual. To protect myself, I am trying to avoid said triggers and work through the ones I can't avoid. This is where the problem starts. 

My grandmother constantly talks about shows like ""My 600lb life"" which is a trigger to me. I however cannot control what people watch or talk about so I can only try to change the topic. Another thing she does is ask if work has ""fed"" me that day (since I get an optional free meal with every shift).  The word 'fed' is a bit of a trigger too since I used to be force fed several times a day via NG tube and I also find it difficult when people directly comment on my diet. 

I know this sounds dramatic, but with anorexia, the smallest things can be the most damaging.

So I asked my grandmother not to ask because I am struggling more than usual at the moment. I explained everything clearly and said I understand she doesn't mean anything by it, but I need to avoid any potential triggers at the moment to ensure I stay on track. 

Today, she said to me ""I am still going to ask if you have been fed"" out of the blue whilst i was putting my shoes on and I was a bit taken aback so I did say ""seriously?"" And she said yes and that she would ask any family member the same question so she sees no problem with it. Our conversation continues as follows:

Me:  ""I understand, but I have put a boundary in place and I would appreciate if you could respect that.""
Her: (laughs angrily? Condescendingly?) A boundary? It's a boundary now?
Me: It is a boundary now since you have chosen to ignore my simple request.
Her: Just leave now.
Me: Seriously? What is the problem with me setting a boundary?
Her: Just get out before I say something that will hurt you.
Me: It's fine, just say it. Get it off your chest.
Her: you make everything about yourself.
Me: I made one small request!

It ended with me leaving for work but I had a bit of a panic attack. She often does things like this and I have never felt worse about myself than I do when I'm around her. I could still be the problem and am not seeing it though. I admit I am focused on building a stable life for myself at the moment so have probably been more focused on myself, but I think I am a kind, thoughtful person too and I will always make time to talk and listen to any friends and family. Relationships are a give and take after all."

She grew up poor, went to college and became an accountant. She now works in an office at a fancy building. Sometimes she says she feels inferior to his peers.
I was raised in the lower middle class, but I navigated my way around and lived in some poor areas when I left my parents' house. Even in these places this behavior was considered rude. 
Starting our relationship I noticed it but I didn't care, over time I just got used to it. But now we're living together and my 3-year-old has started picking on these things. I point out a few times not to do this in front of him. But she forgets and becomes very upset when I ask her to correct herself in front of him. I know she's offended because I'm basically saying that the way she is is not okay. But it's not in those behaviors. I don't know how to deal with this situation, I don't want my son to do this, but I also don't want her to feel inferior like she does at work.

404	488	adjudicated	NAH	"Here’s some context: My SO and I live together and have for a while and are currently engaged. A few months ago, he bought a new handgun as a birthday present for himself. Now, this I was not exactly surprised at, as he had more or less *told* me this was something he wanted to do and to have so that if something were to ever happen, like our apartment being broken into, he could protect us, which I do think is sweet. 

The problem is that I absolutely DESPISE guns. Like, I absolutely HATE them. Idc if other people own them, but they make me incredibly anxious, which he is aware of as well. My dad also has a few guns as well for the sake of protection, which again, don’t love it, but I can’t control it. 

Now, my SO bought it on his birthday and brought it home. I was kind of shocked because I didn’t think he would buy one so soon and I was basically really stressed about there being a gun in our apartment now permanently but I was so panicked and pissed off in a way that I was really standoff-ish towards him at dinner that night and had a really bad attitude. I admit that was rude of me and I really soured the evening. 

Fast forward a few months later and he and my dad want to go to a range and take classes to learn more about them, etc. I’m totally fine with that, and they get along great, and it will be good bonding. But my fiancé is convinced that I am scared of them bc I don’t know how to use them and I told him no, I’m scared of them because they’re guns. He wanted me to come with him and my dad and I said no. He got frustrated and said we could do it when I have availability with work and I said that I won’t be going even if I were available. My fiancé also asked me to ask my dad when he would want to go with him since I talk to and see my dad a lot more often, and I told him that if he wants to go so bad, he can talk to my dad himself. 

He also tries to show me how it works so i understand and am not scared and I do try, but I end up just tuning him out, going on my phone, or leaving the room and shutting down the convo because I get so anxious that my chest hurts. 

So, AITA? I really do appreciate the sentiment, but I also want nothing to do with any guns ever. I feel like I’m being a B about it and am causing contention but I don’t think I can change my feelings toward them, and I think I’m being selfish."

Latelly he's been acting strange. He's being mean to me, calls me names, cancels our plans last minute and overall acts weird. I didn't mind it untill now, because we used to be mean to each other in a friendly way. This year we had a halloween party at our school, so we decided to dress up as lego batman and lego joker. John was supposted to be batman because he's taller and owns only dark clothes. The only thing he had to do was to wear a black shirt. Nothing more. Just a black shirt that he wears almost everyday. I was supposted to draw the batman mask on his face at school. Because i was going as joker i dyed my hair green, woke up two hours early and almost ruined my makeup palette on my way to school. I'm sitting on my chair waiting for John. He walks in like 10 minutes later and what do i see. He's wearing a white hoodie. I was hoping that he'd be wearing the black shirt under it. No. He wore a green rick and morty shirt. I asked him why didn't he wear the black shirt since he texted me hes gonna wear it the day before. He didnt answer and just looked down. It hurt me and I felt betrayed. Now I look like an idiot. We were supposted to look like idiots together, but now I'm all alone in this.

He didn't answer again, so I asked him if he's gonna apologyse, and he said ""yes"". Now im waiting for him to say sorry but nothing. Like am hour later he starts talking to me and im like ""I won't talk to you untill you apologyse"". I was supposted to do his makeup for a halloween event in our town, but as I said, I'm not talking to him untill he apologyses.

314	127	adjudicated	YTA	"I 46 M have been married to my wife Amanda 41 F for 6 years. When Amanda and I met She had two children from a previous relationship Chloe 17F and Marcus 15 M. Despite their father being absent, the children have never viewed me as a parental figure which does not bother me as although I love their mother, I don't see them as my children or feel any love for them. They're good kids, just not mine.

Earlier this year Chloe expressed her desire to move out at the end of the year. I did not think she could realistically afford to move out. Her mother and I both work long hours, so Chloe leaving would mean I would most likely have to hire help or cut down my working hours as she does a lot to help out at home so her leaving would not be ideal. I handle all household expenses so In order to deter her from leaving I suggested she try paying a portion of the bills/home expenses to get an idea of what living alone will be like. Her and her mother both agreed this would be a wonderful idea and so we drew up an agreement that she would pay ¼  of the bills and household expenses and her mother and I would stop financially supporting her.

I thought this would be enough for her to change her mind however she was able to afford this comfortably. I decided to lie to her and tell her that due to inflation our bills and expenses had risen greatly and she would owe me an extra $150 a month. My hope was that even if she could still afford to pay me she would not be able to simultaneously save enough money to move out.

Recently her brother Marcus was doing a school project that required him to analyse our families electricity, gas, water etc usage. I foolishly allowed him access to my study to look over our past bills. At some stage he asked his sister to assist him in his work. When she was looking over the bills it came to her attention that I had been overcharging her for sometime. She worked out roughly how much money I overcharged her and went to her mother with this number. They are now calling me an asshole for stealing her hard earned money and are demanding I return the money. I don't think its fair to call it hard earned when most of it is inheritance from her fathers passing. I had her best interest in mind and think i was just teaching her how the world works, so AITA?

EDIT: thank you everyone for your helpful suggestions, i will be putting the sum she estimated I overcharged her into an account and will tell her i was saving it as a surprise. Hopefully she doesn't come across this post.

A response to some common themes in the comments, i would like to make it clear i have never cleaned my home and will not be starting now. I do not like the noise of the vacuum or the smell of cleaning products. Maybe i went to far by saying i have no love for my step children. I want to make it clear that i like them they just annoy me as they're not my blood.

EDIT 2: you all need to get a life 

EDIT 3: I aged down everyone for privacy reasons which was my mistake. Many people are concerned Chloe is a minor I would like to make it clear she is in fact older however still do not wish to reveal her age for anonymity’s sake "

She told me she was about 2-3 months pregnant. I was there at the hospital, every doctor visit, taking her shopping or going for her, bringing and buying food, gifts, anything to help comfort her. It was her 1st baby and my niece. 

Lately she’s become so unbearable, but every time one of my family members try to tell her about her attitude and how she’s being rude to us because she lost her baby, she snaps back. She lives by herself 30 minutes away in the next city. Her husband left her October 5th, weeks after she lost the baby because he said she was being really rude and angry all the time and he was tired of being treated terribly.

The other day she asked why I stopped bringing her meals, but I told her 2 weeks ago I’m getting ready to transition to a new full time job and won’t have as much time to help her.

She asks why I even bother wanting to see her or spend time with her if I’m just going to be rude and not buy her anything. She’s also been wanting a new phone saying if we want to reach her, she’ll need a new phone. I know miscarriage is hard and after recovery and dealing with it is hard. But I feel like she’s being a big bi*** demanding things and having an attitude with everybody.

I’m at the point where this morning she asked me why I’m texting her because her Samsung isn’t as good and she wants the new iPhone 15. As someone who barely has money to take care of herself and her parent and needs this new job, that’s not in my budget now. Maybe for a Christmas present or her birthday, but I really would prefer not to go in debt for something unnecessary. 

WIBTA if I call her out on it?

305	197	adjudicated	NAH	"AITA? am i the asshole for not going to my friends party?

my best friend is R

I introduced R to T, my other friend quite a while ago

T has since said some fairly rude things not just to me but to R and decent amount of other people. i since have stopped talked to T as i felt it was negative energy 

R and T are now close friends. despite a lot of people telling R that T may be taking advantage of her, and that T has been quite rude about everyone else, R disregards it as she struggles to let go of people and wants everyone to get along

R knows and is fully aware of what T has said about everyone and has done but it’s none of my business so i leave it. i don’t interject in their relationship at all. 

she’s aware that quite a few of my friends and i would avoid social situations if T was involved as we don’t want the conflict that tends to arrive with her. 

We are going out for R’s birthday fairly soon just for an intimate friends thing. a week later she is hosting a party that’s bigger involving everyone. 

she told me T was going to be at the bigger party, i told her “thank you sm for telling me dude, in that case i might leave a little earlier or let you know if im coming because i just don’t feel comfortable with the conflict she can bring, but im so excited to celebrate with you at the first event”

she is upset at me now but i felt like i was respecting my own boundaries and im still celebrating her birthday??


extra info - R is hosting the first smaller event - she didn’t want T there as they’re not super close it’s her best friends housemates etc type of thing

I (F underage), think that my punishment for forgetting to open the window after I showered (so it doesn't get moldy) has gotten too far. Let me speak.

So yesterday, I forgot to open the window for the shower room. My mother was furious when she found out, and I saw how angry she was, and apologized for my half. Apparently, that wasnt good enough, so she mocked my apology. She then stomped upstairs, told me to clean the whole bathroom, then picked out all of my dirty clothes from the laundry basket, and sent me a text. 

(Translated to English)

""It seems like your not sorry for what you did, so from today, I'm not gonna do anything for you. I wont make food, I wont make lunch, I wont do the laundry, and if I see anything dirty or on the floor, im gonna immediately throw it away. I hope you learn to respect your family a little."" 

Andd yeah. She decided to stop doing all that, and when ever I tried to talk to her, she will mock my apology from yesterday. She wont talk to me, so I decided to write a letter to her to apologize. She refused to read it, and kept ignoring me and avoiding me like a plague. I'm still a minor and I can't work. Its my first day, and I just made lunch for myself. I can't keep this up much longer, and I want to confront her. This has happened a few times before, but that was because i did a grave mistake. Personally, I think the punishment went too far, but this can be seen as discipline too. What do you guys think? "

Despite this they tend to get along just fine. Both cats have known each other for two years now, but since moving to our new house this autumn some things have changed. Over the past few months my housemates cat had started attacking my cat most evenings. 

He'll chase my cat, pin her or block her in a corner and proceed to bite and claw her while she yowls and hisses, even pulling out chunks of fur at times. Occasionally when she fight back she will do the same. As time has gone on I have noticed a shift in my cats behavior. She is hiding more, becoming more aggressive towards other animals and is less affectionate with others.

I know that cats can play fight and sometimes enjoy rough housing, but when both cats are hissing, bitting, and clawing it is obvious that something is wrong. I've tried bringing this up to my housemate, but everytime I tell them about what has been happening or show them the behavioral changes that my cat has gone through they've insisted that the fighting is a two-way street.

Because of this view, they've started suggesting that we spray both cats for misbehaving. I've pointed out that my cat doesn't start the fights and shouldn't be punished for defending herself. Now they are mad at me for not making things fair and taking it all out on their cat.

Originally I was going with my boyfriend since Kim is a good friend of his, but my boyfriend has to go on business trip for 2 weeks and couldn't attend so the plan was for me to go alone.

On Monday Kim reached out to confirm if I am going because she's preparing the to buy some snacks (guests would be bringing their own drinks and no dinner). I said yes. However, this whole week has been hellish for me at work. I am talking 9am-9pm almost daily, I had yearly performance reviews with my manager, and had to prepare for some negotiations and visa extension ( I am living abroad and going to immigration office gives me anxiety). I am worn-out and 8 hours bus ride round trip does not sound fun.

Around Wednesday I mentioned to my bf that I would love some time for myself, but he told me to wait and see how I feel by Thursday night. Well, I don't feel better, it also didn't help that I was in Itaewon last year during the Halloween incident. We talked again and my bf realized that making this decision is weighing a lot on me especially with things going on at work. On one hand, Kim is a good friend and I want to support her, on the other is my mental health. So I decided to cancel.

This morning I texted Kim, I explained and apologize, offer to make up for the snacks on my part. She saw the message but did not reply, which only made me feel more guilty for canceling last minute. 

I know I don't really have a legit reason to cancel besides for my own sanity, so please let me know how big of an asshole I am and how I can make it up to her. I am thinking of sending her a bottle for her party."

I, 25F, posted a story spilling the truth about a former friend, Katy 27F. Katy, and I both staffed a college convention together for 7 years. In 2022, I volunteered to make the convention into an offical student organization. Though Katy was no longer a student, we eventually made an exception for her, while stressing to her that she would need to train someone to take over as it was a STUDENT event. Katy and I had a very clear power struggle throughout planning the event. She made several issues for the convention, including getting the convention blacklisted from a talent agency and costing us a $10,000 sponsorship, among others. Katy and I were also friends through this, but she stopped talking to me one day, telling a mutual that she ""didn't like how i handled the convention"". During the 2022 convention, Katy tried to get involved with another staff member, Adam (23M). Adam was not interested in Katy and did his best to make that clear to her. Regardless, she still attempted to drunkenly make out with him, made comments about wanting to be in a threesome with him, and got very angry when any other girls were involved with Adam. All while still dating and then engaged to her baby daddy. Eventually, she moved on to the brother of Adam, and the faculty advisor for the convention, Mark (31M). When I found out they were involved, Katy and her fiance broke up, but Mark was still married.
I graduated and she entered grad school, thus making her eligible for a staff position. A couple weeks ago, I run into a current student. I mentioned to her that I was planning on ""crashing"" friendsgiving, an event that I established and was open to all that helped with the convention, alum, volunteers,students, etc. I was under no assumption that I was not invited to this event. Word got back to Katy and Mark. Mark then told Adam to talk to me about not going as ""a lot of people have a bad view"" on me. Today, I went to search for the convention and found I was blocked from the official account in the span of two weeks. And can you guess who runs the social media? I was tired of holding back. I posted the truth about Katy and what she did on my story. After some time, I remove the posts. Katy and Mark spam called my partner and Katy sent them a message saying that she took responsibility for blocking me, that I was unblocked, and that she wasn't the same person she was a few months ago which I would know if I talked to her instead of drunk texting her. I admit, I did drunk text Katy once as a general message I sent to all of my friends and a second apologizing for something that was not entirely my fault, but at the time I was willing to take the blame for because I hate losing people. Katy never responded to me, never tried to reach out to me, didn't even bother to tell me happy birthday. And as for being a changed person, this block was in the last two weeks. I can't post more details due to character limits, but there is a lot more."

So I, bc I live closest, did grocery shopping, medicins and that kind of stuff and visited her back and forth once or twice a month.Then December came. Mum and I decided we celebrate Christmas on our own. I'm single and could easily quarantine myself to be able to visit her. Then my niece (30f) jumped in. She wanted to see her granny so she and my sister (62f) went to see her. I knew about it and thought they would take a walk or something but instead they took my mum to her summer house and spent the night with her there. When I found out I was furious and scolded them both for being irresponsible. Sis told me later they talked about it and admitted their wrong but my niece didn't take it. She blocked me everywhere. January 2023 I sent an excuse for the scolding and got one back for ""her reaction"" but none for visiting mum. Sis says I should just forget but I have a hard time doing so."
265	239	adjudicated	NAH	"So for context I am a 30 year old male, and my 36 year old sister has a 2 year old daughter. I genuinely do love my niece. I am kind of uncomfortable around small children. I don’t enjoy talking like a baby towards them, but I do try to put effort into playing with her.  I just am not a child person in general, but I do love her and would do anything for her if something were to happen to her parents. 

I have been seeing them a lot more recently so I am around her a good bit already. I would say I see her 3-4 times a month. My family is much more family oriented than I am though and my parents along with my sister think I need to be putting in more effort to be closer with her. They keep suggesting I take her to the zoo, children’s museum etc. I told them maybe I would take her to a park, or just drop her off at my house and they thought I basically said I hate her. I told them I am just uncomfortable taking her myself in public. I just already feel nervous watching a 2 year old myself and I also don’t want to discipline her if she were to act out. They seriously thought I was so strange for saying this. I just don’t know how to say I love my niece unconditionally, but I seriously just don’t enjoy being around small children that much or watching them. I still put in effort though and play with her. 

I know I am just rambling but AITA? I swore my sister was almost crying after this conversation. After I said it too she seriously made it seem that I must hate her child because we were sitting at lunch and she was like “just talk to her” and then I told her she was just making it more uncomfortable for me now. I don’t know, lol. What do you all think?

Edit: just to clarify since the last paragraph is a little confusing, I talk and play with her quite a bit already. I was just saying that once she learned I didn’t want to take her myself because I was nervous about handling a 2 year old myself/sort of don’t want to take that responsibility on, she was forcing interactions between us all of a sudden being like talk with her, it’s not that hard, when I already do that. I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s like she took that in I don’t like her which doesn’t make sense because I play with her and am nice to her at all times.

I also told them I am would love to go with all of them, not just us, sooo…."
460	169	adjudicated	NAH	"My roommate (29F) and I (30M) own a discord server where we play games with online friends who live all over the world (and some irl friends from our home town), and we started playing DND in 2021 when one of our online friends mentioned being a DM. We were excited to play until one particular player joined as well: Alfred (25M, not his real name)

The thing about Alfred is he's really obnoxious to play with and competitive as all hell, even when playing games that don't even have a competitive element to them. He'll brag about how amazing he is as an impostor in Among Us, try to make you play pokemon a certain way, criticize the way you play a game even if it's the first time you've ever played, and in team games will try to backseat and micromanage every step you take.

So when we found out he was joining dnd we were concerned, and for good reason, as in both campaigns he rarely ever interacted with the party unless he had to, would treat the campaign like a competitive video game where the only thing that matters is how high his stats are, and once again would backseat and try to micromanage your actions.

Readers who have had a player like Alfred at their table won't be surprised to learn that he's also not a very good roleplayer, seemingly incapable of playing anything but ""Edgy loner who thinks being an asshole makes him cool #376"" in every campaign/one-shot he's joined for.

When we confront him about his behavior and how disruptive it is, his response will usually be to either go silent for the rest of the campaign, disconnect because of ""connection issues"" or just plain sulk about it and then repeat his shenanigans next session. The straw that broke the camel's back and caused the game to end was when he threatened PVP and to kill my character over a harmless in-game prank. After the session ended, roommate and I asked to talk to Alfred, but he was afk. We messaged him, pinged him, tried to get his attention but he remained afk for 10 minutes before disconnecting and not replying to us at all afterwards.

All of this happened in May of this year. A few weeks ago our DM told us that they're planning on starting a dnd campaign after they've moved into their new home. Shortly after that Alfred spontaneously joins us for one of our weekly Among Us sessions and mentions that now that he's not working anymore he can join more often.

I'm concerned that if he starts to become more active in the server again he'll want to eventually join this new dnd campaign, and I can already see the experience being unpleasant for everyone involved. Already my roomie isn't thrilled about him joining Among Us more often. So WIBTA if I suggested to the DM (or other players even) that he should not join?"
246	81	adjudicated	TTA	"AITH for coming home later than I originally speculated?

I (29F) work in the city and need to take a ferry that has specific departure times. I get off of work at 5pm and usually take the 5:20pm ferry. Will also preface that we moved recently to a new city and I don’t have friends other than my coworkers so when I get a chance to stay and hang with them, I want to take the opportunity since I don’t interact with other people otherwise.  

When work has drinks or events, I let my boyfriend (33M) know that said event or drinks are planned. A couple of times I have said I will try to make the 6pm ferry. To make the 6pm ferry I need to leave the office by 5:40pm which gives me 40mins of time to be at the office hang. If I don’t make the 6pm ferry, the next one isn’t until 7:45pm which is quite a difference. Other times I have explicitly said it intentionally taking the 7:45pm ferry. 

A handful of times I have not made the 6pm ferry even though that is when I’ve initially thought I’d leave by and I’ve always let my SO know I won’t make the 6pm. This has resulted in an argument with me being called disrespectful.

Today we had a work party that I was not sure how long it would run for. I told them I’d probably take the 6pm ferry (knowing that staying later usually results in arguments). As soon as I knew I wouldn’t make the 6pm I let them know. They said they’d prefer me to make the 6pm but that “they wouldn’t tell me what to do”. I said I wouldn’t make it in time and stayed. 

I took the 7:45pm ferry and they are mad and won’t accept any apologies. I understand I shouldn’t set any expectations if I can’t meet them but I also feel like if I initially say anything other than the 6pm ferry, they get upset.

I’ve tried apologizing and explaining this but they don’t want to talk about it. I also understand that this isn’t the first time this had happened so it’s on me too. I just feel like coming home at 7:45pm isn’t that late either."
31	336	adjudicated	ESH	"(Throwaway, people on my main might see this. This post got removed the first time so sorry to any of the people who commented before)

I (20f) had a son “Roman” (5m,) with my ex bf  (22m)“Daniel.” As you can tell by our ages we were pretty young when we had him.  I knew that I didn’t want to go through with the pregnancy but  my mom (44f) insisted that I should keep the baby and she would raise it while I could go back to school and the baby would not interfere with my life. 

I hated the fact that my mother was trying to force me through a pregnancy I didn’t want. My bf at the time and his family wanted me to keep the pregnancy aswell so at 15 I was peer pressured into having a baby.I was miserable throughout my whole pregnancy thinking about how I messed up my life and my body forever for my mom.

Fast forward after I gave birth to “Roman” I signed my rights away as his mother to my mum. Daniel and his family still wanted to be involved in his life. Since turning 19 I have been living on my own. Every time my mum calls me she’s always talking about how wonderful Roman is and she can’t believe I don’t want to be involved. I reminded her that she and Daniel basically forced me into having a child I didn’t want. She proceeded to tell me it was for the better. 

The next week or so I came down to visit and  to my surprise Roman is now calling me “mum” I asked my mum why he’s calling me that and she said it’s because she told him the truth. I know he was bound to figure it out eventually but he’s a 5 year old. I may not like kids but I don’t need him having some expectation that I’m going to be an active parent in his life. I’m also legally not his guardian so I was even more pissed. 

I told my mum she was out of line for that and if she was going to tell him she should’ve waited till he was older. I don’t want go be a parent nor do I have any intention on being one. She yelled at me and told me I was horrible for abandoning my child. I left and haven’t went back since. Daniel and my mum have been calling me but I’ve been ignoring them.

Long story short when i was 18 yo i met this person in language classes, he was in his mid 20s and a walking red flag but I was blinded by being noticed by a much older person. My parents were concerned but by the time they tried to stop it I was way too deep in his abuse I couldnt break it off. A lot of bad stuff happened even after I left my home country to study (we were LDR) and I isolated myself and was basically a shell of a person due to the abuse I endured. Thankfully I managed to escape and slowly rebuilt my life with help of family and friends and therapy, lots of therapy.

Its been over ten years and I am in a different phase of my life. I went back to school, I finally feel where I am supposed to be and enjoy my life deeply and I think I have a good relationship with everyone. I barely think about the abuse and its such a small part of my past at this point. I genuinely see it as a distant thing. 

However my mother refuses to let go of it. I understand because she is my mother and she blamed herself for it but the problem is…she brings it up every time we talk on the phone. She always mentions how either leaving my country fucked my life/my father letting me go was a mistake/how because of that event my life went how it wasnt supposed me. Honestly I am exhausted, I am almost 30 yo and it feels tiring to try and talk about it with her. Ive tried everything from being nice about it and letting her vent to ignoring her when she goes on her rants but tonight was the last straw. 

I was mentioning to her how a classmate is very young (barely 18) and another classmate is flirting with her. I just told her how i felt about it and how i 
I was planning on talking to her about the dangers but she basically started ranting about how leaving and stopping obeying her destroyed my life and I got so hurt that my life was changed forever. I was so taken back by this and told her I had moved on and my life was different and I didnt want to talk about it because it felt she was reducing me to that event. She then started ranting about my dad and when i told her to stop she just said how “she had other problems too that I am not the only one and I need to be more emphatic. That I need to move on and focus on other things and support her”. Honestly I couldn’t understand what my ears were hearing. It was so narrowing to me how I never brought anything about having issues and how she was the one who brought everything up. 

I basically snapped and was screaming on the phone at this point to please seek help because it was bad she just couldnt move past that because she genuinely always talk about it in some way or another and its always the same conlcusion about how my life is not what it should have been because of this.

139	265	adjudicated	TTA	"I (21f) live with my best friend (John-21m) in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom flat. I have the main bathroom and John has the en suite bathroom. My bathroom has a shower/tub combo, sink and toilet and John’s bathroom has a shower, sink and toilet. When we first moved in, I didn’t have a preference about which room so John took the bedroom with the en suite. 

The issue is that recently, John has been using my bath without permission. Normally I’m not super territorial about my space, but here’s my issues:
  
1-	John is having baths that last 2+ hours
  
2-	He moves my stuff around (shoves them into draws) and puts my loofas and flannels on the floor which is just unhygienic
  
3-	He doesn’t clean up after himself
  
4-	I’m not allowed to use his bathroom when he’s occupying mine because he doesn’t want me to go into his bedroom

I’ve brought these up to him and he always says he won’t use to bath anymore but he always goes back to it. He claims his knees are acting up (he’s being testing for arthritis in a couple of weeks) and that the commute to and from work kills his joints. It's been like this for 2 months. Every time I get home from work, John is soaking in my tub so I can't shower, pee, etc. It might seem like a small thing but it's incredibly annoying. 
  

  
Fast forward to a couple of days ago and his boyfriend (Sam-19m) is visiting. He’s seemed pretty sound and has always been nice to me. I go from the kitchen to my bathroom and see the bath has been turned on so I turn it off. I go into my bedroom to grab my towels and clothes and when I get back, Sam is in my bathroom, sitting on the toilet seat watching the bath fill up. I ask him what he’s doing and he tells me him and John are planning on having a ‘romantic bath together’. I turn the bath off again and say ‘well this is my bathroom and I need a shower so get out.’ 
  
He stands in the doorway for a few minutes texting John. I managed to push him out and I had a nice, long 'everything' shower. The entire time, John is texting me asking me to 'hurry up' because him and Sam had plans and I was ruining them. I responded and said 'I'm in my bathroom. I've told you not to use my bathroom because you leave it in a state and you spend hours in there.' 
  
When I get out the bathroom, John and Sam are sitting on the sofa watching a movie. As I walk past them, John says 'are you happy? You ruined our date night.' I just shrugged and got food. 
  

  
However I guess John went and vented to our mutual friends who are split on who is right in the situation. But the general consensus is that I should have just sucked it up and let them use my bathroom for their date night.
  

  
So, AITA?

Me (M27) and J were hanging out all day before her acting class which was at 6pm and lasts up until 8:30pm. The time was now 6pm and she told me she had to go to her acting class and wanted me to drop her off but I told her I had to go where to buy something first before I could drop her off.  On the way she wanted to stop off for food too, she wanted to get greggs but later changed her mind to get subway. I searched up greggs and I found one nearby her house which said it closes at 8pm but as it was now around 6:45 the greggs near her house had ran out of food and apparently closes at 7pm. So I ended up buying her food from subway instead which was 5 minutes away from greggs and 3x expensive. 

The time was now 7pm and the place where I wanted to go to buy an item was 20mins for her house and her acting class was 30mins away from hers so I just thought it would be more convenient for me to quickly buy my item instead of me having to drop her off at her acting class and then drive another 45mins to buy the item as both her acting class and my item were opposite sides of the city (but the item was closer to her house). So this just annoyed her as she wanted to reach her acting class asap but I told her it’s saving me fuel and time if I quickly go grab the item and then drop her off. 

She was reluctant about all this however she decided to go along with it and eventually after buying my item and dropping her off to her acting class (also getting screamed and shouted at by her for me wasting her time) we reached her acting class at 8pm. 

The next day she called me and told me because she reached their with only half hour left of her class the class teacher casted someone else for the role as they weren’t sure if she was coming or not and because of this she lost out on the opportunity and money. She said to me that she now expects me to pay her that money as it’s my fault that she was late and it’ll be me compensating her for what happened.

The housing market is terrible. Interest is high and the houses available at our price range is not similar to her friends or family. She wants to use the best day care in our city as well. 

We recently had an arguement because I told her all of the things that she wants is going to be on me, because she doesn't want to get a higher paying job and I switched jobs twice to increase my salary to pay for expected expenses. 

Tonight I was looking at more modest houses and she pointed out a house that was about 80k higher than the one I was looking at. She says she wants certain features such as a basement, more space, etc.

I told her she needs to manage her expectations and all of this burden will be on me because I'll have to pay for the majority of it. She said her sisters husband doesn't complain when he pays and asked why I want to save money for? I do max out my 401K, and some of the savings is for a HSA.

Huft, I don't know. Maybe I'm overreact but I'm sure Tony Stark will be angry if someone said the one who made Iron Man is Tommy Sparks.

113	25	adjudicated	ESH	"My boyfriend and I work at the same college, just different departments. He is higher up but not my supervisor or anything.

I was in my office that I share with one other person who does not like my boyfriend. We were not busy. My boyfriend knocked on the door (it's locked) and we knew it was him but decided not to answer. He knocked a second time before going through an unlocked door in an adjacent classroom and coming into my office uninvited. 

There were students in the classroom but class hadn't started. He couldn't just unlock the door to my office because he does not have key card access since he works in another department. 

Anyway, he was pissed because we were obviously not busy and so we clearly just ignored his knock. I was pissed because he wormed his way around a locked door by going through a classroom, something I have asked him not to do.

He said he did it because he wanted to do something nice so he was bringing me a cupcake. I ignored him because he has a history of not treating my job seriously and I just really wasn't in the mood to talk to him.

He was angry for the rest of the day, saying what I did was rude and not how people in a relationship behave. I told him that sneaking around locked doors to get in places you don't belong is not how professionals behave."

We have been through a lot together and up until now have had a very happy, supportive friendship. We text or see eachother at least once a week for the past 9 years.  I got engaged 18 months before my wedding date and so I fully admit I messed up by informally asking too soon. It was casual and not a maid of honor “proposal”, but I did ask. 

That was 7 months ago. Since I asked, I would say we have hung out maybe 2 times. I noticed in June that Betty had gotten very distant. I organize alot of social gatherings with friends (going out, week night dinners, movie nights, etc) and it took me 3 months but I realized Betty was constantly finding excuses not to attend (she used to always come to everything). I got a little butt hurt so instead of addressing it I just kind of stopped inviting her to things. I figured if she wanted to hang she would initiate. We pretty much just stopped talking or seeing eachother after this. 

A few months ago I found out through snap chat maps that Betty was seeing her ex boyfriend from college again. Let’s call him Brad. Me and Brad do not get along. He was a horrible boyfriend to Betty for 3 years and he cheated on her multiple times with multiple girls. He then dumped her after college and she was left heartbroken for 4 years. He was heavily cheating on her by the time he dumped her. She never got over him but that’s probably because Brad would snap chat her once a week (she would respond and he wouldn’t). She met with him 2 years ago thinking he wanted to get back together but in reality he wanted to apologize to her for lying about all the cheating. Well now they’re back together and it took her 6 months to tell me. The timeline of Betty getting back together with Brad aligns perfectly with when she stopped hanging out with me. 

AITA for not wanting her to be my MOH anymore? Frankly, I don’t really want her in the wedding because if we don’t talk I don’t think there is a need for you to be a part of my wedding day in that way. I don’t really see us getting past this but I’m scared that I have her in the wedding and our relationship doesn’t get better. OR I don’t have her in the wedding and our relationship does get better and then I just suck. 

I did reach out to get dinner in 2 weeks because I think I owe her a convo if she’s not in the wedding"
200	467	adjudicated	NAH	"i (24f) am a first time mom to a beautiful 2 week old baby girl. her dad (22m) and i moved in with my mom (54f) and her fiancé (47m)  towards the end of my pregnancy as our lease was ending, my mother practically begged us to, and to be financially responsible and realistic as i’m finishing my college degree and this was an unplanned pregnancy. 

i am an only child and am very close with my mom, but in recent years her fiancé has kind of prevented me from feeling close to her. i was hesitant to move in from the get-go because my mom’s fiancé (of almost 7 years now, lol) lives with her—i’ve learned to accept this is who my mom has chosen, but he is the primary reason i moved out my mom’s house at 18. he is very immature, doesn’t have children, seems to “mooch” a little off my mom (he moved in very quickly and still does not contribute to the household financially), has never tried to initiate a relationship with me (to the point of literally not even speaking to or acknowledging me when we would both be home), drinks everyday, and is just downright strange. i’ve always very much felt like he viewed me as an inconvenience, didn’t want me around and even made my mom feel guilty for having me. there are a lot more other reasons for not liking him, but i’ve always treated him with respect. 

when we first moved in, he was pretty awful to me and my boyfriend—wouldn’t speak to us, would be visibly angry, not eat when we were all eating together, and all that culminated in him literally threatening my boyfriend one day and trying to start a physical altercation. he seemed to particularly hate him specifically for some reason. the days after my baby was born, his anger escalated again and he was rude to me, my mom, and even my grandmother and ended up telling my mom he’s been upset because he can’t have a baby of his own (my mom had a historectomy for medical reasons over 14 years ago and told him this on their second date). i literally cannot even look at him any more knowing his behavior towards me and the father of my baby have stemmed from jealousy, that he’s made me feel uncomfortable in my own home since high school, and that he’s made my mom feel guilty for not being able to give him a baby over a decade into their relationship (seriously?!)

he really seems to have no interest in the baby, but every time my mother holds her, she goes over to him and does the whole “oh, isn’t she so cute” “this is your granddaddy!” thing and it pisses me off beyond belief. he is not and will never be my child’s grandfather or a grandfather figure, and i really don’t even want him around her. if he can’t even acknowledge me, why would i want him anywhere near my child? it makes me so uncomfortable but i don’t want to hurt my mom by saying something. obviously while living here i have to be around the guy, but AITA if i ask my mother to please stop trying to initiate a relationship between him and my child?"

118	117	adjudicated	TTA	"I (19F) am an amateur writer, like my sister (28F). With some of her friends, she founded a little writing club to which she invited me 3 months ago.

The problem began almost 2 weeks ago, during the last session I went to. Until then I'd basically reworked my 1st chapter over and over and it was the only thing they'd read from. But that day, I'd decided to give them more, as it could only benefit me since I've been working on that story for 8 months.
  


Because the other member was busy reading my sister's almost finished story (which she's been working on for at least 6 years) my sister was the only one free to read my work.
 After she finished the 2nd chapter, it was clear from her review that she thought my main character arrogant and insentive. Since the MC goes through a corruption arc (When the character worsens instead of growing to be a better person, like Anakin in Star Wars), I reconforted myself by thinking that my MC isn't meant to be fully likable (Something only I am aware of, as I haven't told anyone how the story ends).
  

  
She continued to read, and her face throughout the 3rd chapter betrayed that her opinion wasn't getting any better. Something confirmed when, chapter finished, she turned to me and said 'I hate your MC. She's uncaring and only thinks of herself. People like that repel me"". I tried to hide how hurt I was, and listened to the rest of her comments. Afterward I went outside to cool off.
  

  
5min later, my sister came out as if nothing and asked why I'm angry. I answered honestly that her comment hurt my feelings a lot. To which she shrugged and said that she's right, that my character is unfeeling and therefore loathsome.

And I got angry, saying her own MC is irrationnal and impulsive, but that I had never verbalized it in a way that was as agressive as what she said. Without a word, my sister got back inside.
 In 2 weeks, she still hasn't said a word to me. Not when I left her home that day, not when I asked last week whether we'd meet for the club.

I know what I said was out of line, but so what her comment. If she dislikes my MC, fine, but she could ""package"" her message in a better way.
  

  
So, what do you think ?"

He was recently moved from his home country to where we both currently live again under more than traumatic circumstances, so for a lack of better people to rely on, he attached himself to me. This made us grow close over the rest of our high school career. So close that by the end of our senior year, we ended up practically experimenting with each other regularly. To the point where I was shocked that he didn’t figure out he was interested in men until very recently. That aside, after graduating, we eventually parted ways for around 15 or so years. He had a fiancée to return to in his home country, and I had been saving up to get out of our conservative, and honestly shitty town in order to embrace myself better since I got my first job. To shorten what happened, he lived straight out of an old twisted fairytale featuring unhappiness and divorce, before deciding he had enough and re-needed a fresh start, the same year I got back from having a decade and a half full of sex, substances, and parties until i eventually got sick of everything, and couldn’t bring myself to leave my home town again after I had to return to attend my mother’s funeral. After realizing the coincidence we decided it was best he moved in with me, to both curb the cost and loneliness of northern Canada, and eventually what started out as an awkward roommate situation turned into full on elopement. The issue we’ve run into is that during my previously mentioned days of stupid decisions, I have gotten myself featured in some not so pleasant media that has been archived on the internet somewhere. I’ve managed to get the worst of the worst as far as explicit goes removed, however I can say with no confidence that there isn’t more out there. Even talking about it here is making me want to burst out in tears, so you can see why addressing it with the basically love of my life would be more than challenging. I know I’m in some capacity in the wrong for not disclosing this before he took my last name, however am I the asshole?

Edit: I would like to officially clarify that in as little detail as possible; the reason I haven’t told him yet isn’t because I’m trying to hide my entire past from him. He knows about things far more embarrassing than this, and he even makes/made fun of me for it when we were roommates. So, it’s not like my past is generally a secret, it’s simply that he thinks it was wrapped up in a bow the minute I tried to let it go, and I know that is just probably not true, unfortunately."

My husband and I purchased a home 8 months ago, we only have two cats and live our life peacefully, and happily. We moved to a town about 10 minutes away from his sisters house, and now they want to be over all the time. However, they've only been over about 4 times in the last 8 months, thankfully!

Every time they have been over for dinner, all three sons, a 13yr old, 15 yr old, and 21 yr old start behaving awfully, rough housing, throwing couch pillows, being loud. It's awful. We have a decent amount of new furniture, and they are ruining it.  I told my husband this is why don't want them to visit us! my cats behave better than these 3 guys. His sister will occasionally take the 13 and 15 yr old out to the front and scold them and tell them to stop, which they will for a about 15 mins and then they start up again.

At this point my face must say it all, and i really don't give a shit. 2 days ago they came over for dinner, and the exact same thing happened. I couldn't take it anymore, i got up from the dining room table, went tot he living room and shouted ""can you please stop behaving like freaking zoo animals, this is my house, and my new furniture and you guys are very disrespectful every time you come over!"" ""so just stop or don't come to my house anymore!"" Not to mention this behavior freaks my cats out. They are not used to being around loud rowdy ""kids"". we will usually find them in a bedroom hiding under the bed after the visits.

I went back to the dining room, and his sister and her husband, got up and said they had to get going, and that they were sorry. They left. My husband agrees with me, but also said i didn't have to shout, and call them animals. He didn't necessarily call me an AH, but now his mom has heard, and she's saying ""someone my age shouldn't yell at kids like that""

So, AITH??"
56	148	adjudicated	TTA	"So for background, I(F31) have been going to an aesthetician since 2021 for biotin and vit b12 injections every month, and facial rejuvenation treatment every 6 months. Last year, at my visit she told me they offer a new treatment “Russian lip filler” and told me a bit about it. I have naturally thick, plump lips but was super curious what they would look like with filler. We discussed it and I was persuaded so I got 0.5ml fillers. It was very painful and didn’t make much difference. 

So, I met B(M28) in Feb, we got on well but my mum was severely sick from March to Aug so we didn’t really speak or hang out. We started talking again 2 months ago we’re now dating. Not official-official but going well.

When we met, B complimented my lips and asked if I had filler and I said “no, all natural”. This was about 8 months after my treatment, so the filler had faded at this point. Also this was our opening conversation, so I didn’t feel it was necessary to share that I had had filler in the past. 

3 nights ago I get an email for my 6 month appointment and messaged my aesthetician to reschedule. B is beside me and asks what I’m doing and I explain. He’s asking about the cost and how often I get it done, then says that it’s a waste of money. He’s a financial advisor so I guess it’s his job to say things like this but I ask him to mind his business in a light hearted way. He’s still asking how many treatments I’ve had done and how much it has cost me in total. I’m annoyed but I scroll up to see what date I first message her and scroll past pictures of my lips swollen after having filler. He asks what they are and I explain I sent her a picture of my lips to ask if the swelling was normal. 

B gets angry and demands to know why I lied to him. I’m confused and say I didn’t lie about anything. He starts shouting that he specifically asked me if I had had filler and I straight up lied about it. I said I had only had filler once and it had been 8 months before I had even met him, the effects had already worn off and he didn’t ask me if I had EVER had filler. He had asked if my lips looked like this because of filler, which they don’t, because this is how they naturally look. He said it was a waste of money, I’m wasting money I should be spending on my kids on filling my lips with toxic crap and then lying about it. I asked him not to comment on how I spend my money. 

He was so offended and angry. He said he couldn’t trust me cause if I’d lie about something small, I’d lie about something big just as easily. At this point I was stunned, didn’t know how to handle a grown man shouting at me and wasn’t even being heard cause he kept interrupting and huffing every time I spoke so I asked him to leave and he stormed out. 

I texted him the following morning and he didn’t reply. It’s been 2 days now and no contact I assume he’s ended things. I’ve never seen him even raise his voice and I can’t stop thinking about it, I’m unsure if I’m right or wrong."

They've tried their best raising me and being a family, but recently, living with them feels like hell. I can't go out with friends without telling them exactly who I'm going with, where I'm going, the exact minute I'll be back, what I'll be doing, etc. And if they don't like where I'm going or who I'm going with, they get mad and refuse to let me leave. They track my money (that I earn from my job) and question what I am buying and why. I'm not allowed to close my door to my room or the bathroom while I'm inside no matter what I'm doing. They also fight all the time, almost every single day, mostly from my grandma towards my mom. If my mom folds the laundry or fills the dishwasher ""wrong"" my grandma throws a fit. All the fighting and boundary crossing has lead to a decline to my mental health, so much so that I don't always want to come home at night; I got a school counselor because of this. There are other annoyances and problems but I don't want to make this too long. 

The recent problem is I may have found a roommate to move in with; it sounds like a dream to move away from my parents and have complete freedom, but it would be a hit to me financially, as being on my own would take up 99% of my paycheck, leaving very little to fall back on. 

When I mentioned moving, they freaked out, got angry, and my grandma said that she was ""so hurt"" that I was leaving because she ""must have done something wrong"" by doing my laundry, cooking for me, buying me personal products like deodorant, etc. My mom was mostly quiet during the whole conversation. 

A day later they gave me a different option. I'd start doing everything myself, paying a portion of the rent, utilities, etc. Along with my own bills, and that I could set boundaries myself that they would follow. It'd be better financially, but this is not the first time I've set boundaries that they've ignored and broken, so I don't know if it's worth it to have faith in them. However, I feel bad for doubting them and worry that I'd seem like an asshole for not even trying to let them fix their mistakes. 

So, WIBTA if I moved out without first seeing if they'd abide by my boundaries that I've set?"

This morning she told me she’d make them for us and that she wanted my help in the kitchen. For context I have zero cooking experience so I’ve been trying to cook more with her, she’s been a professional chef for 6 years now. 

We started off fine, then I asked if she could make me a sampler like my mother used to, she said “That’s what your mother does, so if you want one go ask her.” Which confused me since I was just trying to relive some childhood memories. 

She continued to finish the prep work and poured the batter for our first pancake, then asked if I could flip the pancake! When I started to flip it, she accused me of “chopping the edges” and got really peeved and tried to take the spatula. She then proceeded to lecture me about the proper way to flip a pancake. All I was trying to do was be helpful and help her flip the pancake! 

She ended up being upset that the pancakes were cracked and “wrinkly” on the plate. One of the pancakes had a touch of batter on top and she pointed it out aggressively to me.

While we were texting, she said that she ""would love"" to babysit our 4 year old son ""John"" sometime coming up, so that I could take my wife on a date night for her birthday... ""My treat"" she says.. the unrelated conversation continued and then wrapped up. In closing she again mentioned watching our son, saying ""Keep me posted on a date night I can watch John. I would really love it"".

So I decide ok, she is pressing me on this, maybe I'll take her up on it. We find a mutually agreeable Saturday night in 3 weeks. She tells me it can be a surprise for my wife and she is 'happy to see friends happy and getting to spend time with John is a bonus!' 

Fast forward two weeks later. I have to tell my wife about the date because of potential conflict with something else that night. Her initial reaction is ""Are you paying her?"" I said no. Internally it hadn't even crossed my mind to pay her. It was an offer she seemed happy to extend to me/us with no expectation of payment in my opinion. ""No. We'd have to pay her at least $20 an hour"" my wife says.. which in this case would've turned into $80-100. So I ask my wife if she wants me to cancel it, and she says yes. 

So now I'm in the awkward position in the middle of going back to her friend, mentioning the conflict on the calendar, and cancelling on her. Which shouldn't be a big deal, but then I think she will start asking me when we can reschedule .

So.. who is right here? AITA for thinking about just getting her dinner when she came to our house to watch our son and not pay her anything additional? Or is my wife overreacting about the payment thing, and she should just accept a gracious offer from her friend?

He claims it was not cheating by the way because he claims he was not committed but I was so to me it was cheating. I was literally devastated. I didn't even find out about her or the baby till the baby was a year old. It was a huge shock and I had a mild heart attack over it and spent two weeks in the hospital and had to get stents over it. 

&#x200B;

Ever since then, I am super hyper vigilant and never like him to keep secrets or even go anywhere unless i know a female isnt around, like, I know it's a problem but, the trauma and ptsd the cheating caused by his and her actions caused that behavior. And he should understand. He says he shouldn't have to come home after working all day to nagging and so on. That I should be his peace, but then stuff like this happens:

The other mother made a HUGE fuss on Halloween, about him going trick or treating with not only her baby but HER. Don't get me wrong, the baby is accepted by me, none of this is his fault. But she does not need to be involved in any way in my opinion. So he split MY SONS trick or treating in half so my son only got an hour, then he went with her and her son for an hour. I accused him of cheating with her again. He said he only was doing it for the child. My argument, was that if it was for the CHILD then the child should have gone with me and his son and him. That she should have no part of holidays. Those are for FAMILY. She is not family.

Him and his friend had taken the car to get it fixed the week before and this week when we moved the front seat to get groceries out of the car easier we found an opened condom wrapper. We were grossed out and when we asked him about it he said that it was my sisters and not his. 

We work from 10am-7pm 6 days a week and when we get home we are so tired (we are servers so constantly on our feet all day and carrying trays and etc) that we watch youtube for an hour while we eat then fall asleep. We do not go anywhere and when we do something on our day off she either goes with her bf somewhere or her and I do something together. Neither my sister nor I could have used the condom. We do not think it was him but we do think it was his roommate since he sometimes uses the car. 

Anyways this week my sisters boyfriend got mad at her because her guy friend texted her and asked how she was. He got upset and said she was cheating on him and hiding things since she has a guy friend. Her bf has known about her guy friend for over a year (How long her and her on-again-off-again bf have been together) and he does not even live here. he lives almost 2,000 miles away in another State and has been friends with her since middle school. He got mad at her and told her that the condom was probably hers and accused her of being on dating websites (something she has caught him on in the past) and being on sex websites as well selling her body. He has lots of girls with big boobs and butts on his fb but thinks it is fine because he isnt cheating on her but gets mad if she has a guy friend. 

One time he broke up with her and said he was going to Chicago to get his ex back and she was gonna move in with her. A week later they were back together. He still has that ex on his fb and refuses to delete her. He always calls her names and makes her cry so much and beg him to come back and when he does he always has a list of rules that she needs to follow but he does not. 

He is very controlling and manipulative but she ""loves"" him and he supposedly ""loves"" her too. I yelled at him without my sister knowing and told him that he is no longer welcomed to come over here because of the way that he treats my sister. I am so tired of them constantly breaking up and having to console my sister when he is being a douche.

I can’t just randomly bring it up, and I genuinely believe me doing so will only cause a strain on our relationship and our relationships with our relative.  From what I can piece together, he didn’t exactly have the happiest childhood in general, and he gets really closed off and brushes everything off when anyone wants to talk about it.  I don’t know how me manages to live the way he does with these traumas, but he’s been an amazing Dad for the most part.  I genuinely want to help him but I would never want to trigger him or anything like that.  This is why I am strongly considering telling my sister (23F).  We are quite close and often talk about family drama (not spilling anyone’s deep secrets, just our childhoods and stuff we experienced).  However, I know that telling her our Dad’s story would be spilling a secret, so I am very hesitant to do so.  Still, I feel I need to talk to someone about it and I have no one else to turn to.  As for why I can’t talk to the relative about it again, it’s because it was also quite traumatic for him and we aren’t super close anyway.  It’s just difficult walking around with this secret and my sister is the one person I can get advice from.  Of course, I would never want to betray my Dad and share his secrets, so this is where I am stuck.  Additionally, it also can’t be certain that this is a “secret” as it’s regarding a specific event that wouldn’t be brought up unless being specifically referred to.  This could simply be why my Dad has never talked about it… but I truly don’t know.  Anyway, WIBTA if I talked to my sister about a secret I learned from my Dad’s childhood?




EDIT: Thank you to everyone who responded, I truly appreciate it.  I definitely agree that it is not my place to tell anyone else, I guess I just couldn’t see that because of the shock and because my first instinct is always to tell my sister when something happens.  I will now be pretending that that conversation never happened and will never speak of it again unless my Dad brings it up one day.  Thanks again for all the responses and have a wonderful day/night :)."

My bestfriend (32m) and I got into an argument about a month ago because I told him his bf was not invited (reason being is that his bf is very explosive, verbally, and mentally abusive towards him) to our 4 year olds sons birthday party. 
He said he felt like I was excluding him out, but I know I was not in the wrong one bit. 
A week ago he (my bestfriend) reached out to me apologizing and I accepted it and we moved on. 

Yesterday, I finally told him about my surgery (which I found out today that he knew about my surgery for 3 weeks and didn’t even bother to ask me how I’m doing) my bf (which is also his friend) was the one who informed him about it in the hopes that this  would get us to get along again and for him to finally reach out to me after the bday party issue. 

Anyways, he told me he wanted to go and I politely declined with a response of “I already have my bf and brother taking me, plus I don’t want to inconvenience you” I specifically said this because he lives about an hour away from me and has a v8 vehicle, and tbh I don’t want to see his bf (he takes him EVERYWHERE bc the guy has major trust issues)
this plan of mine has been set in stone for a month, on top of that, my brother already asked for the day off. My bestfriend  just lost his job and has no money (we help him from time to time with groceries and gas money when he needs it even before he lost his job) and tbh he just hasn’t been reliable and I cannot be stressed out when my surgery day comes. 

I thought that he would be understanding about the situation because we haven’t been on speaking terms when I was planning all of this. 
AITAH for calling him out on his bullshit after he said I was being passive aggressive with my response?
I’m going to insert the messages, but at this point my bf and brother advised me that it’s probably best (even though I know it’s going to hurt me) to end the friendship because he (my bestfriend) keeps making everything about himself. He never used to be like this (until he met his bf who manipulates him)   First it’s our son’s party and now this. He hasn’t even bothered to ask me if I’m okay or I’m in pain. NOTHING. He just got upset and assumed that I was being passive aggressive because I declined for him to go. 
Here are the messages between him and I

Me: “Hey I’m getting surgery next week :/“

(Mind you it took him a whole 24 hours to respond back to me)

 Bestfriend: “Yea I heard (bf) told me and I told him I'd be there if you want me to”

Me: “No it's ok, I have (bf) and my brother going with me, plus don't want to inconvenience you. It’s an hour the opposite way, if (bf) h as to pick you up, it’d be a total of 3 hours of driving”

Me: “I would've loved for you to go with me but we haven't really been on speaking terms, my brother already took the day off too for it”

Bestfriend: “Well it is your choice, if that's how you felt at the time I'm not upset at you or offended at all”

Me: “I would assume you wouldn't be upset or offended. Plus you have a gas hog and my surgery is in *********. Totally the opposite way”

Bestfriend: “Ok well is it because you don't wanna inconvenience me or because you thought we weren't on speaking terms because you'll need to pick one, Because I don't have energy to waste on high school pettyness rn I'm sorry I dont”


And that’s where all hell broke loose on both ends and I did not hold back because at that point he was just being too much. AITAH? 
I hope I gave enough info! Thanks in advance."
311	224	adjudicated	NAH	I've been receiving texts from an online shopping website about order confirmations, I finally clicked on one and it took me to the checkout page with someone's information on it, I can see where they live, their email, what they bought ect, so I emailed the email and the two names matched up, the lady claimed that I was wrong even after sending ger screenshots of the oder messages, her home address ect, her home address matched the one she gave me, she showed me information and how the numbers didn't match but she sent me her information that was on a notes app on your phone instead of the bloomchic information which clearly stated my phone number linked to her account, all I was asking for was her to remove my phone number from her account because it was making me uncomfortable that I kept receiving all her notifications and it made me uncomfortable to know where she lives. After contacting her a second time with more proof, she said she'd contact her attorney if I tried to contact her again to remove my phone number, this lady also has my phone number linked to medical accounts and I receive constant calls about her doctors appointments and insurance . Am I the asshole for wanting her to remove my phone number from her accounts?
254	297	adjudicated	TTA	"So basically I (16f) had a situationship with this guy (16m). I broke things off with him because he had a big ego and our convos just felt like a one sided power struggle. He would say bad things about my outfits and call it constructive criticism and he was also suspiciously close to one of my bsfs. When I wanted to communicate with him about it he just dismissed it as me being jealous and took it as a compliment.

At first I didn't want to be too harsh and said we could still be friends but I later realized it'd be better if we weren't, plus it didn't look like we were talking anyway. Fast forward a few weeks, I went to the library with my friends (also his friends) and he ended up sitting at another table since I told them I felt uncomfortable, but I was fine if they chose to sit with him.

I wanted to get food with my friends and one of them asked me if she could invite him. I said I wasn't comfortable with that, so she ended up not asking him.

When we got back some of them went to sit with him and found him crying since they didn't ask him to come. After a bit he decided to go talk to me even though they told him not to.

So back to my perspective. I was cramming for a test when he went to me and asked to talk. I told him I really didn't have the time and if we could just text about it when I get home but he kept pushing it.

He asked me why I was uncomfortable even tho I told him clearly why during the breakup (minus the ego part since that would've been harsh/unnecessary). He also said he couldn't talk to his own friends because of me, but I told him that he could literally talk to them anywhere else just that I personally need space when I'm with them. He said, ""is it that hard for us to be at the same table? am I not a human being to you?"" and that it wasn't fair to him that he had to keep distance when he didn't know why even tho I told him many reasons. Ultimately I told him that I understand but there was nothing that could change how I felt and keeping distance was the best for both of us. Also afterwards he spread rumors to our friends like that I said ""well, someone has to lose""...

Honestly I feel like even though I genuinely felt bad for him being excluded, a lot of it seemed like he was trying to victimize himself and distract other people from how I felt. Also I didn't get why he chose to confront me about this instead of our mutual friends and why he did it when I was visibly stressed. Even though he initially said he was okay with me wanting space he kept deliberately pushing my boundaries. I get that from his perspective, it seemed like I stole his friends and turned them against him, but I don't think this is the case. Is this just his victim complex, or AITA?

She’s been round our house for dinner and has slept over before so she is familiar to me. As we passed I smiled and waved to be friendly. I didn’t cross the road or try to speak to her. She smiled and waved back at me and I didn’t think anything of it. 

Later that evening my daughter came downstairs and asked me why I’d been waving at her friend. She said her friend messaged her and said it was creepy. I apologised and promised to not wave again but I feel like that is a perfectly normal interaction?"
29	334	adjudicated	ESH	"I (33F) & my bf (32M) went on a camping trip with R (33M) & V (M) in Medano Pass. We'd stay the night, head down to the Great Sand Dunes in the AM, & head home that evening. My bf & I had our truck & R brought V in R's truck.


Being a primitive road, it had areas that were trickier to navigate. I was trying to give R help in getting through the harder areas, as was V. R tells me, ""I don't want help. This is my property & I know how to handle it."" I could tell R was getting anxious about the situation, but as I felt his unease wasn't directed at me & thinking that even unsolicited help wouldn't do any harm, I continued to try to give him advice. R ultimately made his own decisions & eventually caught up to my bf. 


The campsite was across a stream, in a small thicket of trees; R pulled in closer to the trees. We set up, did our thing, & turned in for the night. I can't sleep when camping, so I maybe got 3 hours, which puts me on edge at times, but overall I'm in good spirits.


As we're leaving, my bf gets back across the stream. R, on the other hand, is planning the best route. I hear R say to my bf & V, ""I need help navigating the trees"" (to turn his truck around). I don't give this much thought at 1st, & when R is about to cross the stream, I again try to offer help. He says, ""I'm just going to do it this way,"" to which I simply say ok. R drives through the stream, but on the other side gets his rock runner & a small bit the frame caught on a mound of dirt. R gets out, angrily slams the door & goes to look. After he gets unstuck, he mumbles under his breath, ""She doesn't know what she's doing...""


Tired & unwilling to deal with what I perceive as misogyny, also become upset. We get through the pass & make it to the Dunes. I pull R aside & I ask, ""I understand that you're mad at me & only me. Is that true?"" R says yeah. I say, ""Well, you asked the men for help. Shouldn't you be mad at them too?"" R just stares at me. I also mention how all of those choices he made were his & that he acted like a child. R continues to just stand there. I acted out of pocket saying ""Are you going to keep throwing a fit like a bitch, or are you going to apologize like a decent person?"" R says that he will do none of those. In my anger, I flip him off, saying, ""Go home then if you're going to act like that."" He gets V & they leave.


The next day, I texted R saying I'd offer an opportunity to get a coffee with me so we can discuss what happened. His answer was, ""No. You called me a child and flipped me off."" I reiterated how that even though I was wrong to react the way I did & apologized, all the decisions he made were his decisions, that nobody forced him. I told him that in accepting help from only the men made him look chauvinistic. R replies that he asked me multiple times to let him make his own decisions, but instead I ""shouted"" at him (I didn't) until I got my way, & that he doesn't see the point of a friendship with some who won't respect him/his property."
206	228	adjudicated	NAH	"Hello! I’ve been struggling with this ever since me and my friend have had an argument. Now I know I might be the asshole in this scenario but just bear with me. We’ve been online friends (we will call Gage) for about 4 years. Our friendship was always something special to me ever since we met so that’s why I’ve been thinking this through for so long and didn’t end our friendship.

 Now for around 6 months things haven’t been so great. We had a lot of arguments and it was mostly about Gage not responding or leaving me or read for weeks and sometimes even up to a month. At first I thought it was just because of stress in school or something like that. But I started noticing he was online even if he said he didn’t have time or something like that. I asked him about it and said that he wasn’t online even tho I’ve caught him a couple of times. He also started to be more cold towards me and I found it kinda odd because we always were on good terms. 

One day I asked my other friend if he could message Gage since they knew each other. So I waited for Gage to say he is going offline and then told my other friend to massage Gage. As you can already imagine Gage responded. They were talking up to half an hour. The next day I asked him about it (I asked him times before if he needed space or anything). He ofc denied it which made me kinda mad but I kept my cool and continued to try and resolve this. He made up some excuse about needing time which I ofc understood and gave him space. 

The last straw came when I was in a much darker time and needed someone to talk to. I asked him and he straight up ignored me for days. I asked him why every time he needs someone to talk to I’m always there but he’s never there for me and he just said he’s busy/he was talking to other people. 

This is what actually broke me since I’ve always been there for him anytime he asked so I told him that he should start treating me more nicely and not just as his therapist friend. At that point I saw that the friend that respected me all those months ago left and I was just talking to someone I didn’t know. 

It’s been about a month since we last talked and he’s been ignoring me all this time. I genuinely do not know what to do since this really broke me. I feel like our friendship which I cherished for years is now just an old memory. 

But I do truly want to know if I am the asshole in this story. And for further details or questions that anyone would like to ask I will be available in the comments. I might not reply for a bit but will hopefully reply to everyone in time.❤️"
295	179	adjudicated	TTA	"I'm 16(F). My younger brother (6) went up to me and shut my laptop in the middle of me doing my schoolwork. I had food on a napkin sitting on it for a second so I could get situated, and it went all over my computer. I got up and I had an annoyed expression because of it

My mom told me I was being mean and that I had an attitude. I told her I was annoyed that my brother did that, and I don't understand why it was wrong of me to feel that way. She went on and on telling me I've had a bad attitude lately and that I'm being ""mean"" to everyone

I don't understand how me being upset on my own terms has anything to do with anyone else. Am I supposed to be positive and in a good mood 24/7? I don't get why me being upset means I'm in the wrong

My parents get mad and upset all the time. Just last night my dad screamed at me for no reason because he was in a bad mood. My mom snaps at me all the time when she's in a bad mood. So why is it wrong of me to display emotion that's something other than happiness? I tried to explain that to her but it didn't work

I ignored her the entire time she was getting onto me because it wasn't fair that I was getting in trouble for feeling a certain way. I told her I wasn't going to listen and to leave me alone because she wasn't being fair

It's like she watched me and tried to catch the slightest negative emotion to bash me for it. She got mad again when I ignored her, which I get, but I don't understand what I did wrong in the first place. She said people can tell when I'm annoyed at them, and I told her I'm not going to be happy when someone tries to be rude to me. AITA?"
478	308	adjudicated	TTA	"I'm 29 yrs old and still living at home with my parents. For reasons i cant get into now, I had to give up my bed to my niece(14) in a room i shared with my sister (her daughter). So the only other place to sleep was the living room. Its been fine with me for months now. But recently we got a new tv after a while without it. So now they (niece and sister) propose that i occasionally go back to sleeping in the bedroom on nights they want to stay up watching tv or a movie.

I have a problem with this. Because as someone who has never had their own place or sense of privacy. These few months sleeping in the living room, alone, has given me a sense of space. Especially at night, after 9pm (when everyone usually goes to bed). Its quiet and i can have a moment to myself - Be with my thoughts and have some semblance of privacy. With their proposed option, it will take that away. And disrupt my routine, especially in the mornings as I get ready for work. 

Am I valid with how i feel about the situation or am i simply making a fuss about a minor inconvenience? Which feels like a major violation of my privacy."
493	188	adjudicated	NAH	"My daughter’s school did not choose her to be valedictorian for graduation and she is still salty about it. Her high school normally goes with the highest grade point average but it can be between the top 5 students if one demonstrates high academic achievement like winning a competition. My daughter was the leader of and won a national robotics  competition and being the top 1-2 students she was sure she would get valedictorian. But the school broke away from their criteria by choosing a girl who had been in a car crash caused by a hit and run driver. 

The girl wasn’t badly injured but her mom died from the accident and she went on to finish the year with good grades. She wasn’t in the top 5 students and only took 1 AP class where as most previous valedictorians came from the IB or full AP course load. My son was valedictorian 4 year prior and also did full IB. So my daughter was really angry when she found out because she felt like it was unfair and also thought it was racist because kids and parents had been complaining only Asian students ever got the award. According to her the last 8 years it was always an Asian who had won and while my daughter is half Asian (so is my son) the school was trying to find a non Asian to appease the families. She said she would have been ok with the other 5 top students winning but to give it to someone with just above average grades when the criteria was about academics made her feel like she and the other 5 (which according to her were all asians) was discriminated against. 

I don’t know if this is true and I understand why it’s unfair and even agree with it to an extent. But the girl lost her mother and still finished the year with good grades and that should be recognized.

Also the valedictorian had been made public and if my daughter tried to get it overturned it would make her look like a sore loser. I did explain all this to her and told her she was going to MIT already with a partial scholarship and everyone knew she was smart so she needs to accept sometimes unfair things happen. She was extremely angry at me for not going to the principle about this and my wife was also angry because she felt like the school discriminated against our daughter.

She is now in her first semester at MIT and while she likes it she says most people in her classes were valedictorians in their high schools and she feels like she was robbed when she worked so hard. I thought she would forget it but she seems to still be angry about it and not as close to me as before. AITA for not talking to her school about this when I could?"
28	101	adjudicated	ESH	"I (20m) actually moved out of my dad's house when I was 16 and went to live with my maternal grandparents in another state because things with my dad and his family became so toxic. The reason for this is that they chose my dad's second wife over me. I was 6 when I lost my mom and 8 when my dad met Diane. I never liked Diane. Initially it was because I saw her presence as being disrespectful to my mom. I was a kid, a little boy who lost his mom and I was a momma's boy so maybe not too surprising. But Diane showed me early that she did not like mentions of my mom. She never said it to my dad or his family, just to me. She'd say it hurt her feelings that I would talk about mom around her like mom was somehow better than her or that I would rather have my mom back. I told my dad and my extended family and they were like oh don't be silly, Diane loves us and she talks about your mom when we do, this is because you don't like your dad moving on.

Over the following few years dad and Diane got married and had kids together and Diane would tell me how much she hated the fact even dad's family missed mom and spoke about her on occasion. She said we were all supposed to be hers now.

The more I spoke out the more dad would tell me I was trying to ruin his new happiness and that it was cruel to expect him to stay alone forever. I told him he could do better than Diane and I got a lecture from him and my family saying Diane was amazing and mom would have loved her. I even showed them a video I took of Diane making annoyed and disgusted faces and rolling her eyes when mom was mentioned and I was told she knew I was filming and she was sick of my shit.

My dad agreed to let me go at 16 because I told him I would not try to get along better with Diane and I wanted no part of his family anymore.

Two months ago Diane exposed herself to the family and really showed them how she felt about mom. One of my cousins was celebrating her birthday and it was one of the milestone birthdays and mom was mentioned and photos were shown of mom since she was my cousins godmother. Diane went off on how she hated my mom and was glad she was dead and she wishes she could erase her from everyone's memories and a bunch of other stuff.

My dad and his family (minus his younger kids of course) all came crawling back and sent me messages apologizing. I ignored them until it got so overwhelming that they all got together while dad called my grandparents to talk to me. They apologized again and when I said nothing right away they told me I should accept their apology and talk to them. This is when I told them their apology is meaningless to me. They told me I shouldn't say that, I'm being petty, because they're trying to make amends. My dad said nothing was so bad that they couldn't make up for it and I said it was still meaningless. They ended the call pissed off at me and saying I was being childish.

345	41	adjudicated	INFO	My sister is 4 months away from being 18 and we are 6 years apart. I moved out when I was 13 and missed 10 years of her life. Recently I moved back to my home town and had my first kid and 3 days after he was born my sister moved in. She has been here nine months now and I'm considering asking her to leave. She doesn't contribute to the house besides the internet bill (no chores or babysitting) she's hasn't cleaned a dish in nine months. Really the reason I want to ask her to leave is because she disrespects my boyfriend (father of my child) I'm currently pregnant again and my sister also suggested if she were in my position she would make herself... not pregnant. Now she's refusing to acknowledge my son (who loves her) or interact with him when he wants a little attention. She will intentionally ignore him. I'm at my wits end and I feel like if she can't be a member of the family she needs to go. WIBTA?

Also I have 3 other groomsmen so I’m not standing by myself. Last year I proposed to my fiancé who is now going to be my wife in a few days. TW was there when I proposed and seemed very happy and excited for me to get married. JM seemed like it too. In the next couple weeks after I proposed , me and my fiancé had picked out a date and I had picked out my groomsmen, so I asked JM and TW. They both said yes and were excited that I even asked him to be in the wedding. After I asked JM He said, bro we should definitely all get fitted together. Which sounded like a good idea but when it came time to do it, they didn’t fall through.So we all got them done separately which was no problem took 2 minutes to get fitted anyways. Couple months later me and my fiancé instead of having separate bachelor and bachelorette party’s we had one together JM came but TW didn’t. A week after that, it was time to make a $70 deposit on our tuxedos. They almost missed the deadline for the deposits. Now here we are the week of the wedding and it’s time to pick up our tuxedos. Pick ups are three days before the wedding and you make the full payment when you pick up. I let them know a week in advance when pick ups was. They both missed those days and I asked them why they had both said they other things going on. to my knowledge it was nothing crazy or any family members past for them to miss those deadlines. so after that, I clearly seen that it wasn’t a priority for them to be in the wedding so I told them not to come.

302	311	adjudicated	TTA	"I (25M) have always had a debilitating fear of bees, wasps and any kind of bug that can bite or sting. I don’t know where it comes from, and I recognize it is unhealthy has made me lose a lot of time outdoors in the hotter months.

My friends all know about this fear and just how bad it is, and it is often a point of joking for them. I don’t mind as we often roast each other and it’s all in good fun. 

Recently however, three of them decided to take it upon themselves to “deal with this fear once and for all.” We live in the country so there’s always fields of bugs and such flying and crawling around all over the place. One afternoon they collected nearly a dozen bees and wasps from outside and trapped them all in my friends screened in porch connected to his house. After luring me inside this porch with promises that we’d be having a chill afternoon of drinks and board games, they ran back inside and locked me in the porch with all these stinging creepy crappies flying all over the damn place.

Immediately realizing my peril, I yelled to let me in the house. They all first laughed as they thought it was funny, but as I felt my heart start to race and realized a panic attack was coming on, I screamed to let me out or I’d break the sliding glass door.

Not believing me, they said the bees were not a big deal and I would see once I got stung that it was not a reasonable fear to have. 

I am a medicated individual due to work related anxiety, and have had anxiety attacks in the past where I’ve had to go to the ER, so I took this very seriously. I gave them one more chance to let me in before I’d break the door, and when I saw a paper wasp buzzing right in my face, I grabbed one of the porch chairs and smashed the glass door.

I ran inside and locked myself in the bathroom, hyperventilating and not sure if I was gonna be able to calm myself down. After about 20 minutes of sitting in there and my friends complaining about the door, I got in my car and drove home.

The next day I get a Venmo request for $400 to replace the glass on the door. I explained that I got trapped in a situation against my will where they knew I had an irrational fear of bugs and that I did not feel responsible for the door as I gave them multiple attempts to let me in.

Two days later and now the main friend is saying he won’t be inviting me to anything until the $400 is paid, and is threatening to take me to small claims court. I didn’t ask for any of this and feel like my mental health issue was weaponized against me. Am I the asshole?"

She told me to book at 11.30am and when I went to book they only has 12pm onwards bookings.
I called her 3 days before the event and asked if 12pm was OK and she said yes, she has a church fund-raiser she was going to but would be at lunch and the event wasn't far from the restaurant. 

I arrived at the restaurant just before 12 and went in and sat at our reserved table. 
Just before 12.10pm I messaged my friend and said I was here and waiting. At 12.20pm she messaged me back saying she was held up at vent and would be there in 15 minutes.

My response was damn I've already been waiting 20 minutes.  She did apologise (as she mostly does when she's late) 

Twice I had the waitress come over and ask if I would like to order and I said No thanks she should be here any minute. 

By 12.40 she still has not arrived or messaged me any updates, so I messaged her suggesting we make it another time. No response. 

At 12.45 I messaged her again and said that 45 minutes was too long to wait and I was leaving. 

I picked up the gift I has brought for her and left.

At 12.50pm I recieved a missed call and message from her saying she was there out side on the deck ( I told her the booking was at the inside section) and asked me has I ALREADY left.

I was too angry to respond and she has not called me or tried to contact me since ( 4 days ago) 

Take into consideration I work 12hour shifts and my days off are important to me, as well as I moved a few things around that morning to make sure I wasn't rushing to get to the lunch.

I have a feeling she's going to try and pin this on me as I walked out. AITA?"
385	64	adjudicated	TTA	"For 11 years, I have been begging my parents to watch my favorite show (The Walking Dead and, of course, all of the Spinoffs) with me. Not to watch it on their own, but to watch it WITH me. Like, spend time on the couch watching it with me. For 11 years, the answer has been no.

We just moved to a new state, so now that we're all in a new place and don't have our things going on aside from work and school, we have much time to spend with each other. So they finally said yes to watching my favorite show with me, and they loved it, like I knew they would. I can't get them to chill out with it, though. It's mostly my mom. My dad does what we want. I work full-time and go to school full-time. So I only have a little free time, which I spend most of with my parents.

I want to watch the show with them, I do. I've only begged them to watch it with me for 11 years. But I don't want to and can't watch it every night. I need time to myself, and I need time to do homework. I have devised a schedule that allows time for everything and where we all can compromise, but my mom refuses to. Every discussion about it ends in an argument and ends with me feeling like I have to give up all of what little free time I have.

My dad just got a new job that will take him away from home for about a year, maybe a year and a half. He'll be home for a couple of days here and there. So it'll just be me and my mom, and unfortunately, my dad will have to watch the show separately. We watch it at night, so we can watch it together in different places like we did when he was away training for this new job. She said that she wants to be able to watch the show on her own when I can't watch it with her.

My schedule would give me Mondays and Tuesdays for school, and she'd watch a different show or a movie on her own (I even offered to have her come down to my living room and watch whatever she wanted so she wouldn't be alone). We can watch the show on Wednesdays or go to a movie (we have discount movie nights on Wednesdays and usually do that on those days). On Thursdays, we can watch the show during dinner, and then I can do my own thing. And on Friday and the weekends, we can watch as much of the show as she wants because I have the rest of Friday night and most of Saturday and Sunday to do what I want. We usually do stuff with her new friends during the mornings, but I usually have the rest of the day to myself. I feel like this is a reasonable, if not slightly confusing, and over-complicated schedule that allows everyone to get some of what they want. We watch the show and hang out together. I get my days for school, and I get time to myself. She is not happy with this schedule.

I told her I didn't want her to watch it alone because I wanted to watch it with her. I just can't every night. I need to have time to myself, too. Now she's mad at me. I feel like absolute crap. I love her and want to spend time with her. Am I the asshole?"
130	31	adjudicated	TTA	"I (21f) am in a dilemma in the moment regarding an argument I had with my mom(40). For context my family and I went to dinner at a nearby restaurant, my treat, to have some quality family time. While we were waiting for our food my mom commented that she was tired and wanted to sleep when she got home. My dad commented that she could sleep for the rest of the afternoon and wake up to drink water and afterwards go back to sleep. My mom didn’t like the comment and that is when my little sister repeated what he said to my mom. I might note that my sister didn’t repeat this in any tone of aggression toward my mom. My mom became upset and was visibly upset for the rest of the time. 

When our food came and my sister offered her a napkin my mom flat out refused in a very rude tone. I asked my mom why she responded like that to my sister in which as replied back “What am I doing? Why is everyone attacking me?” 

I said “No one is attacking you. “ 

She then decided to ask for the keys and walked out of the restaurant leaving her food in the table untouched. 

We finished our food and took hers to go so she could eat it. When we got home my little brother(5) was having an issue and calling for my mom we tried to help him but he kept calling her. During this whole time my mom ignored my brother until I told her to please listen to my him. She then proceeded to say “He has a dad, I’m not his mom or yours.” 

This is when our argument began where I told her that she was acting immature and needed to understand that her way of acting is not right. She said that everyone was against her and that’s when the rest of my family chimed into the argument. We told her that her way of acting is not right and that she acts defensive when we say something she doesn’t like. In the end I told her she needed to grow up and stop taking things personal when we are trying to make her see the wrong of her ways. She became upset and said that she is a bad mother who didn’t raise us right. She left and drove off. As of now she’s in the driveway but refuses to come inside. 

So AITA for saying that she’s immature?

Edit: I’ve seen a few comments and I think I should add some context. 

1. My mom asked to eat out and I offered to pay. 
2. My brother is autistic and when he asks for someone he refuses help from anyone else. "
95	347	adjudicated	TTA	"As the title states, I had suffered from bullying at school for a few months now, from being randomly called by name by people I very much hate to sexual harassment (light, but really disgusting). And despite my usual bad temper, I held it in and didn't react to it till yesterday, when I was on the verge of a breakdown and losing control, I reported this to the school counselors and had the problem resolved (still in the process of that I think, haven't heard the outcome yet).

Anyhow, I'm mentally exhausted, especially since I was repressing my anger, which caused me to have a shorter fuse outside of school, and the fact that I had almost broken down (which... let's just say could have ended a bit bloody). Today, I'm being forced to go out with my family, and despite what I told them, they said that I had to ""control my temper""  and ""go out and look around"", when all I want right now is to just stay home and work on some DIY projects to help me recover.

So, am I the asshole for wanting to stay home and not exhaust myself further? Or should I have just listened and played their ragdoll?"
175	175	adjudicated	YTA	"My SO (Spouse) cannot bear to hear our 18m child (Kid) cry.

More recently, starting 15m old or so, Kid has started to cry because of denied wants. E.g. 

* Access to the toilet--which Kid sees as a water table
* Not being allowed to use the trampoline (3 ft diameter, indoor)
* Denied food that they won't swallow, or have recently spat out. 

Spouse often chides me for being too hard on Kid, for not being caring enough, or calls me from across our home to change a diaper. 

I recognize that Spouse parents the child overnight as Kid currently wakes up 3-4x through the night. With some exceptions, Kid has not slept longer than 5 hours in their life. 

I recognize that Spouse is dealing with a substantial amount of pain for which Spouse has diligently sought solutions.

I recognize that Spouse does what they can to maintain the household: Cooking, coordinating cleaners, researching nanny and care options for Kid. 

Spouse is certainly no slouch, and I'm grateful for that.

From the pregnancy through to the present, I have tried to give Spouse grace for their own busy schedule and take care of the ""honey-dos"" that come my way. 

I have also shared with Spouse my aspirations and goals.

Spouse has reassured me on more than one occasion the time for me to work on achieving that goal. 
  
I work hybrid, and when I'm home, Spouse interrupts me for things which do not require my exclusive attention or input. I had mentioned to Spouse before that just because I am home, does not mean I'm not working. And yet, I am interrupted:

* Look at this funny meme
* Does this color look like a true winter?
* (From the other side of the home) Change Kid's diaper!

Recently, it came to a head. 

Spouse went to sleep around 10:20pm. I took the time alone until approximately 1:30am to make some progress on my own projects before going to bed.

I was woken up by Spouse around 7:05am--I normally need to wake up 7:15. With Spouse asking me to bring Kid out and start the morning routine. 

I pick up Kid to leave Spouse alone to sleep in after another hard night. 

Kid starts crying because they want to use the trampoline.

I ignore Kid, knowing it's a want, not a need. 

Spouse comes out upset that I let Kid cry and chastises me for it. 

We argue, during which Spouse tells me--while they're holding Kid--to change Kid's diaper.

We settle kid. Diaper changed, meds given. 

I head back to start my workday. 

Spouse calls out asking me to take Kid so Spouse can go back to sleep, I accept knowing Spouse had a rough night.

Kid opens the Diaper Genie (Diaper trashcan) and tries to put some of their toys inside. 

I tell Kid ""no"" and lock the Diaper Genie. 

Kid cries

Spouse comes out chastising me again for letting Kid cry. 

In a rage I ended up kicking the play pen door, breaking it, shouting at Spouse with Kid in earshot, ""I give, You \[Spouse\] get, You \[Kid\] get"". Before storming off to start my workday. 

I buy another door to replace the one I broke.

AITA?"
