Lately we've tried to set up boundaries with my SO's parents. ""Don't wear perfume"", ""please speak our common language in adult conversations"", ""dont kiss the baby on the face"". The common language one is recent. I think my MIL stopped speaking our common language when I started finding my voice as a mother. She liked to show how I'm an outsider.
Fast forward to this week. I've just had it. MIL especially always pushing me for a reaction. It's so obvious. Maybe I'm petty but she started calling the baby ""my baby"". My husband asked her not to and she just won't stop. 
I want to cancel Xmas with them. My FIL makes open comments about my weight and MIL doesn't respect boundaries. They do REALLY love my daughter though. 
AITA for canceling Xmas with my inlaws to have a quiet and enjoyable first Xmas with my SO and baby?"
73	290	adjudicated	ESH	i’m F15 and my sister 18F has finally moved in with us after 5 years since she has a visa now. She’s been here for a month. first i was totally ok with her as i have only brothers and im the oldest on my moms side.The 2nd day she was with us she was on a call with a guy on my brothers phone, my brother is M10. this guy was very old, she was saying disgusting things to him in spanish thinking i wouldnt understand. Another thing is she might be an adult but is completely childish and immature, she yells and invades peoples person space and likes to touch other peoples things. I tried giving the benefit of the doubt that she left her family behind and is adjusting until my dad told me she is usually like this. Later on, i found out im sharing a room with a girl who likes to run away to see older men and does gross sexual things which makes me well uncomfortable. My sister cleans, cooks and does laundry while we are at school and while my parents are working, my mom and dad praise her for it, but when i used to do it they bring me down and say that it’s something i should do daily since i was the lady of the house this obviously bothered me. again i tried to give benefit of the doubt maybe their trying to make her feel at home. What was my last straw was when my mother started to compare us,she told me how next to my sister i was basically  useless that she did the jobs that i was meant to do. i would also like to add, i do my jobs as im supposed to, which bothers my mom as well. she says why do i only clean when its my chore day. What made me ultimately yell at  her today was this. everyday after school i pick up my brothers, today was very cold, and there’s a break in between where my mom is able to pick them off and drop them back home and go back to work. Since i have to walk and it’s very cold i asked if she can pick them up. My mom yelled at me saying it’s my job and i had to do it, i asked her again and told her i was very sick and week ago and didn’t want to get sick again. she harshly said no and my sister said she’ll do it. My mom said “your making your sister pick them up when she’s not even used to the cold and doesn’t have winter clothes” i tried to keep calm but i did have a bit of an attitude to it i responded with “it’s not my fault you didn’t buy her any plus im still picking them up” it upset her that i sorta had a point so she yelled at me “It’s because thanks to your sister i have time to come home and relax since she does all the chores in the house why couldn’t you be like her, she’s not as useless like you” this struck me very hard. without thinking in a loud tone of voice “you want me to be useless i’ll be useless than don’t complain when i don’t help out, you never appreciated anything i do, you want her to be her daughter then sure take her i don’t care enough anymore, just wait to see who she really is, im done” the guilt set in later i disrespected my mother
374	288	adjudicated	TTA	"AITA for telling my coworker I won't block his wife in social-media just because he told me to?

So, last month I (F30) went with my friends (F, 29, 31 and 33) to the movie theater to watch a concert of my favorite artist. I ran into a co-worker (M36) and his wife (early 20s). I always thought I got along fine with my co-worker , but I wouldn’t go as far to call him my friend. I went to say hi to him and he introduced me to his wife, let’s call her Vivian.

Later during the concert (keep in mind that while we have assigned seats in the theater, nobody was sitting, it  was anarchy) I noticed VIvian was alone, so I approached her and asked her about my co-worker and she said he left because he was bored. I kind of felt bad for her, so I told her if she wanted she could join our group, she ended up spending the rest of the concert with us, after the theater we all went to have dinner, we bonded with VIvian over our love for the artist, and by the end of the night we all ended up adding her in social media. 

That’s the one and only time I have seen her in person, and our interaction in social media is just tagging each other (and the rest of the group) in news about the artist we both love. This Sunday she posted pictures of a batch of cookies she was making. I commented they looked delicious, and she sent me a PM saying she actually made A LOT of cookies, she said she could send me some with my coworker if I wanted. I saw nothing wrong with this so I accepted. 

Well my coworker gave me the cookies yesterday, and he said that  until Vivian  gave him the cookies for me, he didn’t know we had kept in touch, but he didn’t like it, so I need to block her now and never speak to her again. This caught me by surprise, while we have never been friends, we have always been polite to each other and I can’t think of a reason why he would want me to block his wife. I don’t have a reputation of being problematic or anything like that in the office. I don’t keep up with the office gossip, in case he is worried I’m going to tell her what he is up to. In case he is worried I’m Ms-Steal-Your-Girl, I’m  not a home-wrecker and I’m straight anyway.

Anyway, I was too surprised to actually give him a good reply, so I just told him he doesn’t get to tell me what to do, that I’m not going to block someone just because he told me to, that if he has a problem he can discuss this with his wife. 
Now, I’m second guessing if this was the right thing to do. Maybe I was too harsh, and I could have talked about it with him. Maybe I’m creating unnecessary drama. AITA?"
155	357	adjudicated	TTA	"So I recently got into an argument with my aunt over the way I'm treated. For context, I have autism, adhd nd am being evaluated for PTSD. My parents, as a result of guilt for the way I turned out, do tend to baby me a bit. Im independent for the most part too. 

So my aunt came to stay for a bit due to temporary plumbing issues, I don't know what and idrc. I thought everything was ok but recently she confronted me about me 'infantilising myself' and setting the autistic community back because of my 'act'. No, she isn't autistic or knows anyone except me with it. 

Her arguments are that: I sleep with a shark stuffie, I eat very small meals (recovering from an Ed but she doesn't know), I talk to my mom about my constant nightmares (she apparently has overheard me and thinks its dumb I dont get over them), I watch cartoons and my clothing choices resemble a little girls, I call my parents mommy and daddy and it's weird (I personally think it's creepy to call it weird), I sometimes sleep next to my mom, I jump aroumd and wave my hands when happy, nd I watch only horror or cartoons. 

There's a lot more but it's just minor stuff like my phone case isn't mature,i like to cuddle with my mom, I let my mom baby talk me (it doesn't mean anything to me, my mom Just loves that one of her many kids likes to spend time with her but it's essentially the same way she talks to the dog) just dumb stuff like that. 

I told my mom and dad, who weren't happy with her and they're threatening to kick her out if she's mean to me again. I thought I was NTA but after searching on reddit and tiktok, it seems many autistic people HATE this treatment and it's apparently demeaning and offensive. So now I'm worried I'm making people think it's ok to infantilise the disabled. AITA or is it not a big deal?

Edit: for context, I'm in my late teens and am not on the 'mild' side of autism as people call it. Whilst I'm mostly independent, I still struggle a lot with my mental illnesses and mental health as a result of my PTSD and forcing myself into independence. Nobody else I know has autism so I just assumed everyone lived like this "
104	332	adjudicated	TTA	"So for obvious reasons, I'll be changing everyone's names and any identifying details. For context, my mom ""Sharon"" (38F) married my stepdad ""Randy"" (33M) about 7 years ago. From previous relationships, my mom has me, (17F) and my younger sister ""Shelley"" (14F). Enter ""Randy"". He and my mom started dating and everything was fine. About seven months in, he proposes, they get married. We've had our fair share of troubles like any family does. He oversteps his boundaries as a stepparent, loses his jobs often, and has had a problem with other women. I try to cut him slack because people make mistakes and it’s his first time at life too. Over the years, “Randy” always seemed to find some stipulation that I had broken that prevented me from seeing friends or even leaving the house sometimes. He has my location and will call me when he believes I’m sitting in a parked car for too long, when I’m at someone’s house that he doesn’t know the parents of, or if he thinks I should come home. This has obviously happened on several occasions and has ruined countless plans because he finds some reason that I need to be home ASAP, even if my mom doesn’t agree. He and my mom decided to split up indefinitely after one of these “judgement calls”. During that time, I was actively afraid of “Randy”, and I had frequent nightmares about him coming to whatever house I was staying at and taking me. Things stayed that way for a month, with his family all on my mom’s side. Eventually, though, he and my mom wanted to make things work. So here we are now, back to how things have been for the past seven years. After a debate over text with my mom, “Randy” came unannounced to my friend’s house where I was spending the day. He picked me up and took my phone because I hadn’t cleaned sufficiently enough. During the car ride, he went through my photos and messages. Like most of my peers, I have certain photos in my hidden folder, and that’s the first place he checks. This makes me uncomfortable not just because they weren’t meant for him (or anyone, really,) but also because some of the fears I’ve had involve “Randy” doing things I can’t discuss. My mom came into my room shortly after and assured me that he felt bad for going through my phone, that nobody would be invading my privacy. However, this morning I heard them talking and “Randy” was chastising me for having those pictures and talking to one of my exes. I want to have a normal relationship with him, but he oversteps boundaries and makes me uncomfortable very often. He takes control over parenting me when my mom and I have both expressed that we feel it does nothing but cause problems. I don’t want to leave my mom but if I can’t figure out how to change something, I plan on moving out soon after I turn 18. There must be something I’m doing to make him react like this, but I’ve tried changing everything and it never helps. Is there something I should be doing differently? AITAH?"
394	279	adjudicated	TTA	"So D(26f) has been besties with T(23f) for a couple years who also happens to be my(23f) best friend of about 6-7 years. I never had any beef with D other than a weird vibe that she never liked me…
Last month T asked D to be her girlfriend and she said yes. It was cool I fully supported, as a member of the LGBTQ+ family myself and what I thought was a friend. So T took her ex fiancé of 2 years  B(32m) back. I guess D didn’t want to have a poly relationship after T had already said she’s gonna be with B regardless. Then T took a break from social media for a month and didn’t talk to anyone. During that time D hadn’t made any effort to call, text, show up to T’s house, nothing. All of a sudden D calls me and a new friend, that had left the group once before for causing issues. She asks for advice bc she doesn’t know how to tell T she doesn’t wanna be with her if she’s with B but then after the call she says not to say anything. T is basically my sister. 
So I ask T but in a way it sounds as if I’m checking in on her and asking her how she feels about it all since they haven’t talked and she says she doesn’t know but she’s summing they aren’t together unless D says something about it. I say oh okay and tell D what T say and she’s cool with it till a couple days later after she hangs out with the new friend C and all of a sudden after T texts the group chat that she’s changing her socials and phone number, (T didn’t know about D’s feelings yet). D calls me yelling at me saying I shouldn’t have said anything and that I need to stop lying and talking shit about people behind their back. I haven’t don’t any of those other than checking on T. I would’ve asked even if D hadn’t said anything bc she had already told me she hadn’t talked to D that whole time. 

So AITA for checking on basically my sister?"
377	138	adjudicated	TTA	"Edit to clarify: Mary was NOT looking for a free procedure.  This I can confirm.  She was asking for other people, and also works with rescues.  

Hi guys.  I work with a bunch of local dog rescue groups to spay/neuter and adopt out the stray dogs (there are TONS here) in the area.  I am homeless, and I run a dog rescue page on FB that is quite open about this fact.  A few days ago, one of the other rescuers (we will call her Theresa) made a post saying that they had a couple of cancelations for their mass spay/neuter trip, and that if anyone wanted the available time slots, they could have them.  These appointments have to be booked months in advance, so it was a good offer.  

A woman I do not know (we will call her Mary) commented, saying that Theresa could ask the vet to use these two slots to gift free spay or neuter to someone.  Theresa laughed and said the vet is not going to do it for free.  Mary said she meant that Theresa could cover the cost. Theresa said (truthfully) that she barely has enough money to cover all of the costs associated with the rescues and the fosters she has now, and that most of it was already coming out of her own pocket.  The reason she was offering the slots is that it takes quite a while to get the appointments, and someone could benefit by having the opportunity now.  

This is when I chimed in, replying to Mary, and I said ""I think money is a bigger issue in the rescue world than you seem to realize.""  She responded and said that she knows it is a problem.  Theresa also replied and said she does understand.  I left it at that.

Fast forward 2 days to last night.  I have forgotten entirely about this exchange, as I comment, share, and make a lot of posts on FB, mostly pertaining to dog rescue.  A different rescuer I know (we will call her Crystal) sent me a message asking if I had ""exchanged words"" with a good friend of hers named Mary because Mary was ""really offended by you.""  Again, I had forgotten about the exchange, and said that the name does not ring a bell, but does she remember what day it was or what it was about.  She described it as me responding to Mary's comment on Theresa's post on Facebook.  So I found the comment thread, screenshotted it, and sent it to Crystal, saying, ""This?""
She said yes, and that she agreed my comment was really offensive.  I asked her how it could be construed as offensive, and she insisted that I am wrong and that it is really offensive because ""Mary is a poor woman.""  

I have shown the conversations to a few people, because I started second guessing myself and wondering if I am just socially clueless, and they have all had the same confused bewilderment when I said Mary and Crystal found that statement offensive.  AITA?"
124	231	adjudicated	TTA	"My girlfriend and I have been dating for just under a year. But before this we dated for 2 years before taking a year and a half long break. We live in the same city but 40 minutes away. She works as a nurse whilst I’m a freelancer and even though her work is near my house, she still prefers the 40 minute drive back home.

Now we see each other every day, but almost 99% of the time it’s me making the 40 minute drive out to her. I’ve asked her why she doesn’t stay at my house or come out to me very often and she says it’s because she just has all her stuff at home so it’s easier for her.

Now for context, we are travelling next year so money is something she says she’s being cautious of.

About a month ago we had a big disagreement about joined efforts, and I expressed my feeling I was making a bigger effort for us to see each other and she somewhat agreed and apologised but her takeaway from that convo was that we may have to see each other less, as she can’t promise being able to drive out to me in order to save money for travelling next year and said I should do the same and we’ll just have to be okay with not seeing each other as much. To save money I even caught the bus out to her a few times which is an hour and a half one way to show I’m committed to seeing each other but also committed to what she’s said.

Yesterday she said she signed up for an expensive gyms 6 week challenge, she talks about worrying about money and this thing is $85 extra a week. The gym is near both her work and my house, and she’s now said after our convo only a few weeks back that she’ll happily come and stay at my house more. I immediately got annoyed at her and vocalised this. I told her I felt frustrated because one, she spent money when she said that was something that meant we had to cut down seeing each other, and two, she now has said she’s happy to come stay with me at my place more now and I just feel frustrated because I feel like she’s doing the opposite of what she said she was able to do only because it’s convenient for her now. She responded with “if you think thats how I view you and want to use you then you really don’t know me”, and something along the lines of, “I just saw it’s a chance for us to spend more time together and I can come to you for once but you haven’t taken it that way at all”. She left to go her first day of the challenge and I didn’t say goodbye to her. 

I have ADHD and tend to spiral on one loose thought and also have trouble articulating myself at times, so I wanted to come here and ask if I Am the Asshole."
68	238	adjudicated	TTA	"I (22F) went to a party this hallo-weekend with a few friends. A little quirk I have is being able to recognize songs quickly. I've just always known a lot of songs, and learning lyrics is something I enjoy. We were chatting with a few people I hadn't met till that night and multiple times songs had come on that I liked so I sang along to them. 

My close friend, as a joke, said ""You literally know every song."" To which I replied ""Yeah I literally know every single song in the world I can't lie."" I said it in a fake-arrogant way.   


Some random dude in the group heard me and started trying to challenge me on it. He started saying stuff like ""No you don't, that's impossible!"" He then went to his Spotify to bring up songs to test me. He got weirdly passionate/aggro about it.

  
I really didn't think it was that serious so I deadpanned ""I'm obviously joking."" I got a few laughs from the group, and I guess he got embarrassed and went silent for the rest of the night. I heard from a few mutual friends that he thought I was a b word.

Contextualizing: because of the autism, their parents always have been strict and my BIL became accommodated to this. My bf has 2 degrees (marketing and communication)  while my BIL lives to watch anime. I guess i don't need to say hes a virgin and have never felt one single warm kiss in his mouth. Lately, hes in our feet and complaining to my mom in law that we go out a lot and nobody takes him, he enters in my bfs room without knocking ONLY when im there, he is always in our way. My bf never was close to him and they hardly went out together because my BIL don't like going out a lot. Recently, i found the ""secret"" tiktok page of my BIL where he posts things like ""good morning beautiful ladies"" and ""where the single ladies at? hmu"". I laughed a lot but i perceived that maybe he is annoying with us because hes jealous and cant have a girl on his own, since he doesnt take care of his appearance and hates going out. 

Saying that, a long long time ago one friend of mine runned a woman fake account, and this friend likes me a lot. I was talking to them about this situation and they offer a chat with my BIL in their fake acc just to give him a taste of what having a GF looks like. 

Would I be the asshole if i agreed to this only to incentive him to actively go out and really look for a girl by giving him tips of what to do and what not to do? "
194	109	adjudicated	TTA	"I (32m) am getting married to my long term girlfriend Gemma (30f) at the end of November. 

Now me and Gemma are having a small wedding with only close family and friends invited mainly because we don't want it to be an inconvenience to others and choosing a venue is really hard due to Gemma's allergy.

Gemma is allergic to dogs and is terrified of them due to a freak accident when she was younger (that's also when she found out she is allergic to them). While her allergy is not deadly, even when taking anti allergies her face would get significantly swollen, have red marks all over it that are visable even with heavy make up and she would constantly sneeze. Lockdown was a blessing in a way that she could wear a face mask that was helping with allergies, she is still trying to wear face masks to help her, but can't always do it inside as people immediately think she is ill and don't really want to have us in their restaurants/cafes.

And to the issue. My sister ""Kate"" has diabetes and has a service dog ""Lenny"" to help her. I absolutely adore him and Gemma is not scared of him either, however due to Emma's allergies I have reminded Kate not to take Lenny to our wedding (I was dropping some parcels for her this week as she was away and they were sent to my house) as I believe my future wife should be able to enjoy her day without the swelling, which would be hard to avoid due to the venue being quite small and private (Gemma gets the reaction even if there's a dog in the same supermarket even if it doesn't touch her).  My sister has reminded he is a service animal and I can't ask her to not to take him, but I have told her he is still a dog and being a service animal doesn't miraculously cancel my wife's allergies and she knew about them from the start. I'm not asking not to take him to any family get togethers, I am just asking not to take him to our wedding.

My sister and my mum both called me an asshole and are not talking to me and have threatened not to come to the wedding, which I said is fine as I value my wife's comfort more. But still aita?"
406	303	adjudicated	ESH	"I (M36) am the father of a healthy 3 month old boy. When my wife was 8-9 months pregnant, I told my brother-in-law (30) to ""step up"".

Backstory, my wife and I had been trying to get pregnant for a year and a half, which included a miscarriage which devastated both of us. When she eventually got pregnant with our son, she didn't have many complications, but towards the end of the pregnancy her blood pressure shot up and she was borderline being diagnosed with preeclampsia. At the same time, my wife was working full-time in a stressful job (divorce attorney) and her mother was diagnosed with cancer. 

My mother-in-law (lives about 10 minutes away from my home and is unfortunately a widow. While she lives alone, she does not drive and is dependent on my wife (for the most part) and my brother-in-law for everything. While she sometimes does get her groceries delivered, she needs help with throwing out garbage, cleaning/laundry and transportation to doctors offices. She's a very demanding woman on top of her medical issues. 

Now, my brother-in-law lives about 45 minutes away and at the time had been visiting his mother to help out maybe once or twice a month. He has more days off than my wife and didn't work on weekends. He's also been very social with his friends on weekends, which was the only down time my wife had to relax from her stressful job and her pregnancy. However, since my wife lives so close to their mother, my wife was always asked to run all the errands after work and on weekends. I had a great relationship with him until the event which lead to this post.

I got fed up with my wife having to do everything for their mother and told the brother-in-law to ""step up"" given her pregnancy and complications. While I could have said it in a more friendly tone, he got the point of what i meant. As a result, he ignored my wife for a few days and cut me off completely. Apparently, he took it as a slight against his masculinity and inability to take care of his family (must be an Italian-American thing). He deleted my contact info and unfriended me on social media and we haven't spoken (other than when I said congratulations to him when he got engaged recently). I changed my passwords on all my streaming platforms I shared with him. However, as a result he has stepped up and is doing more. He's the godfather to my son, which really pisses me off and I am still waiting on him to congratulate me on the birth of my son. He's not welcome in my house and I can't help but tell my wife how much I despise her brother. 

Reddit... am I the asshole?"
84	321	adjudicated	YTA	"Hello this is my first time posting here. This happened to me earlier tonight at work so i thought I'd share.

So I'm working nightshift at Wendy's and they have me sitting outside in the flooded drive thru line behind the building taking orders. I had been to work for 2 hours already (which is the minimum amount of time required to work before you can take your 30 minute break) so I went inside to order some food because I hadn't eaten before work.

When i went to put my order on the board so that I can eat in between customers or rushes (which is something that order takers and drive thru cashiers often end up doing) my coworker (another cashier) snatches the receipt out of the machine before I can grab it and asks me, ""Where do you think you're going on a lunch break? Other people have been here longer than you and we haven't eaten yet!"" 

I tell her that I'm going to eat outside and she looks at me like i said something outlandish or offensive. 

After that I go to the bathroom for maybe five or six minutes to try and calm down from the loudness of outside (the building next door has had a huge noisy generator going since I came to work) and then go back into the kitchen area to get my food.

When I came back my coworker told me to get my own food (because i ordered chili fries) and I was like okay whatever. But then she goes and tells the general manager (gm for short) that I'm getting food and the our gm stares at me and says that nobody has gotten to eat. And I just go, ""Okay...,"" because I honestly didn't know what I was supposed to say and then our gm goes back to bagging food. And I'm confused because this wouldn't be the first time that i or anyone else has had to eat outside! In fact I'm stuck stuffing fries into my mouth in between customers most days that I work the back drawer!

So as I'm waiting for my wrap to be made i go in the back to put my portable wifi box on charge (since management doesn't share our wifi password) and I ask the drive thru cashier if anyone was going to get a break today and she tells me that no one gets a break when the gm is working night shift (probably because alot of people call out on weekend closing shifts)

And now it just felt like my coworker wanted me to suffer with her when in reality we all should be getting a break! So am I the asshole in this situation?

Side note: I say almost all of my coworkers didn't eat because I saw someone eating in the break room so my guess is they're getting to have break at a reeeeally slow rate or that only the cashiers weren't getting a break tonight.

Edit for clarification: I didn't take a break all I did was get food to eat while still working the drive thru. And we were so understaffed that there was nobody to replace people if we took a break. I am not the only one that sneaks something to eat during shifts like these."
371	424	adjudicated	ESH	Well my bf (now ex) broke up with me and unfortunately I have no place else to go so I am stuck living in the same ho.e as him and no space to move my things so I live here in the exact same space as him and sleep in the same bed when he has nights off. He wanted us o be friends but when he found out I was using again he kinda just quit being apart of our relationship and so I had to take at home tests for him bc he couldn't tell if I was high or not. Most the time I was high when he thought I wasn't and not high when he thought I was. I passed all these test and still he wouldn't take time out of his day for me and has been this way for over a year. He wasn't present for my pregnancy nor when I lost our child. So now months after that tragedy of my placenta abruption he has broken up with me and expected me to stay. I asked him if he wished to save us  and he said a part if him did. But I can't tell and he looks happier now without me.. it's hard to take in but I am taking it day by day. So someone please give this dumbass some advice? Am I the asshole for not giving in and doing it even though he gave me nothing in return? Why keep wasting my time if he isn't going to put in the effort to be with me
388	156	adjudicated	ESH	"A bit of a background:

My mother passed away when i was two years old. My father was in Air force at that time. He married again 2 years after her death to a gem of a woman (mum). I did not know she was not my birth mom; the reason is that she treats me as her own son, I always felt the love and affection my real mother could have given me, my father was posted at a variety of place hence I became a military BRAT (BORN RAISED AND TRANSFERRED). She loves me more than anything. I soon became brother to my sister who is 6 years younger than me. Due to my affection for my mum my paternal family felt jealous and one time during a vacation when i was with my paternal family, they told me everything about my mother's death and my father remarrying (for purpose of causing a rift).

I cried for hours that day, but it only raised the respect i had for my mum because how well she raised me and never let me feel that i am not her son. I told all this to my mother who went LC with her in-laws because they tried to break a mother-son bond. My father also resented and rebuked them for this but kept in touch.

The said incident is a year back when i was (16 years) old. My birth mother left some property for me before she passed (she was the second child of her parents) which i would inherit when i am 21. I came to know about this as my birth mothers' brother (my uncle) kept in touch with us (my father and mum were always nice to him, and my uncle and mum are sworn brother and sister). The said property is worth a lot, as my birth mother parents were rich and sort of politically involved.

My paternal family came to know about this and my father's brother (Bad Uncle -BG) showed at our doorstep demanding half of it. His reasoning is that my paternal grandparent property would be equally dived between the two so why should I get more money while my cousin (his son) won't get anything.

This soon caused a huge argument as my father wanted me to have a good future and not wanted me to worry about college and buying a home in future. This inheritance would let me do that. My mum told my BG and others that ""in no uncertain terms they would tolerate his shit. BG thought mum convinced me and my dad to refuse and he exploded.

My grandparents and other relatives took BG's side, as they all hated my birthmother and mum, in argument they called my mother a c\*\*t and a Gold-digger. This is where i think i was a asshole , I could not take it and said all nasty abuses a teenager could say and told him he is a greedy son of b\*\*\*h.

He left stunned and later all of them called and texted to tell me i was a blood traitor and the A-hole for standing up for my mum who is not even related by blood. My only reply was relation is not by blood but by care and affection.

Am i the A-hole reddit."

Let the story begin. 

A close friend of mine have been asking my family (wife and daughter) for dinner at their home over the past few months. 

So, we decided to accept the invite and went to their home last weekend. The friend decided to not cook at home and decided to have take out, sure not problem. I went with him to Indian restaurant and he ordered quite a few varieties of dishes, rice, naan etc. Total $250.

Meal was nice and enjoyable and there was quite alot of food remaining. 

After a sometimes it was time to go home and while we were saying goodbye, my friend just brushy said when you get home, transfer half for the dinner. I didn't at time registered and just agreed. But when I got home and started thinking about it, I just felt weird. We were invited because they wanted us to come over and host dinner. 

So the question is, WIBTA to go back and outline why I shouldn't pay or just pay but be wary in the future.

*edit - the leftovers was not offered and remained with the host. "

I meticulously planned my Indiana Jones Halloween costume, even buying a second-hand leather jacket for the occasion, it wasn't like cosplay level but took time and effort to make it look decently cool. 
Last year, my brother wanted to borrow my costume last minute, but I didn't lend him the costume which made me feel bad and also my parents called me egotistical; so this time, I gave him the heads-up that I won't be borrowing him anything and if he doesn't prepare anything this time it will be his fault, I told him that on October 5 when my costume was ready. 
Fast forward to the 28th, he asks me to borrow it for a pre-Halloween gathering, and I agree on the condition that I'll need it during the day on halloween, but then on the 30th he ask for it again and i reluctantly agreed to let him wear it on the actual day, too. However, he didn't express any gratitude, and to make matters worse, my cherished Chelsea leather boots were stretched because of his uneven legs (one leg is 5cm/2 inches shorter so he wears special insoles). When I confronted him, he stayed silent. 
Now he needed help with a model for university, (important but not really grade determining) I would have helped tremendously, since I own a 3D printer but when he asked me I refused rudely, now I'm being called childish and immature by both him and my mother.
I know it was my decision to lend him the costume, but neither a thank you for borrowing the costume or an apology for damaging my boots really got me fuming.
Am I in the asshole here?"

Since then, she’s gotten my new car towed and called animal control on our dog 3x. This last time was simply because she walked out with me to my car and back off a leash. Apparently even that short distance and with me, she needed to be on a leash even though all the neighbors do the same thing or worse and don’t get reported. Did confirm with animal control it was her. He said he understands there seems to be a dispute with my neighbor and the best thing to do is to “kill her with kindness”. 

Anyway, her “just a friend” is over right now and parked in our shared visitor’s spot without a parking pass. WIBTA if I got him towed?

408	269	adjudicated	TTA	"For context: the country I live in do not allow us to buy a house unless we are married. Renting prices are sky high due to the land constraints our country faces. 

My family of 5, moved in with my husband and I a couple of days ago while waiting for their home to finish renovating which would take approx 1 month plus. I am currently pregnant and we live in a 3 bed room flat.

Growing up I could not stand sharing rooms with my sister F(26) because of her snoring and untidiness. At the age of 18 I started working shifts,and had to wake up at 3am for work. There were many sleepless nights. in my parent’s home we had also only 3 rooms. I ended up moving out of the room to my brother’s and he moved in with my sister. I told my sister that I didn’t mind sharing rooms with my brother, but she had to move into the smaller room (my brother’s) which she refused. years later, my parents sold the house and rented while waiting for their new home to be built. I shifted into the smallest room. My siblings shared the bigger room. 8 months later, I got married and bought a 3 bed room flat.

Fast forward to today, my parents new home is almost ready but the rent at the current place was to be increased. They didnt want to pay for it as it was only a month left till they could move in to their new home. My mother asked if they could with me for a month and I was ok with it as long as everyone cleaned up after themselves. My mother has helped my husband and I, so I felt like this would be a good way to repay her. In my siblings room (at the rental place), there would be food particles in their rooms, mouldy walls, spoilt air conditioners and their rooms would smell. During the moving out process my mother constantly screamed and threatened my sister to clean up as the rented home had to be handed over. She was a hoarder. My step father mentioned that my sister’s room constantly had a stench, which I too agreed. But my sister did not care one bit. 

On the first day of her moving into my home, the room started to smell. I freaked and told my mother I could not have this here. My brother on the other hand has been cooperative, he cleans up after himself so I was thankful for that. My mother spoke to my sister and told her she’d have to move out else where for the time being because I could not deal with it. (Plus I did not want to stress myself as I am pregnant.) My sister started blaming the weather, her skin condition and every other thing she could think of.  But not the fact that she was just unhygienic. She cried wolf saying that everyone thinks she’s a burden. All I wanted was for her to acknowledge and do something about it. She could have apologised and said that she’d be more hygienic. But No. she made a whole scene and made it all about herself. Not even the fact that it was my home that I worked hard for, or the fact that I was pregnant. She blocked me on socials and played victim. 

I know that my relationship with her would never be the same. But I’m putting myself and my pregnancy first. AITA?"

	\- My mum thinks it is completely normal for her to fire personal attacks at me since I was 13, ( I am now half a year off 16, I know 16 is the age limit for Mumsnet but please let me stay or at least send me a copy of the responses) like calling me rubbish, useless, saying I have a revolting personality, selfish on a regular basis. She berates me for being ""weird"" all the time and tries to make me feel ashamed of my quirks.
  
	
  
	\- I am being extremely ungrateful given that she has set up a reward system to stop my sister's bullying at her own expenses. The system does help; now my sister is just mean, but not to the point of bullying.
  
	\- When I asked her if she would also set up a reward system if I had been the one bullying, she told me that I need to reflect on myself if I think she likes my sister better, because it is my personality's problem that she likes me less. She also said that my grandparents, dad, and aunts and uncles all like my sister better.
  
	
  
	\- She said that people who like me just doesn’t know me well enough 
  
	
  
	\- To explicitly say that 100% of the time where I have an argument with anyone else I am in the wrong because she ""knows my personality""
  
	\- Last time's incident with my aunt where long story short I got dragged down to a supermarket by my aunt when I was in the middle of eating. I got berated for 40 minutes and was in tears by the time we got home. Mum shouted at me first thing and was mad at me for at least a few days. She said I was just crying because I can't take negative feedback from others. She also told me not to complain when my aunt favors my sister
  
	\- She always thinks the worst of me. For example, yesterday my sister deliberately came into my room and ate seaweed, which I have an issue with its smell, on my bed. I was so mad. After that she showed my her piano trophy that she won yesterday and I said no I don’t want to see it because I was mad at her. Mum accused me of being jealous that my sister is better than me. I tried to explain what was going on and although she thinks sister shouldn’t be eating seaweed on my bed and said to her ""behave yourself please"", but was still adamant on how I am just being jealous.
  
	\- There are still a lot of other similar incidents.
  

  
Here is the thing that might make me the AH--- I shouted at mum for an hour straight telling her she is a horrible parent, which is very out of line.

I have always worried about my friends' grades and my cousin's grades since I only want what's best for them. Just recently me and my cousin had gotten into a screaming match during lunch about finishing homework (since she had not finished her math homework and we had a test that day). She'd always complain to me about whatever her problems were (home, family, work, relationships, etc.). I never said that she was wrong for how she felt and often protected her from being a topic of gossip (I gave a lot of stern talkings to people). Now during that screaming match she yelled how it was both our grandmother and I who made her feel so stressed. I love my cousin, I really do, but when I brought up that I was also stressed and just wanted her to do her best she continued to yell at me. We haven't talked since yesterday and this morning I sent her a message reading this:

""I'm quite tired of having to be the bigger person and apologizing first. I know it may have been the heat of the moment, but it's really times like this where I feel like whenever someone has a problem, you just have to one up them. When someone gives you a solution, you find a counter. We were all stressed, but at times like that, it does feel like you fail to ever think about maybe I have certain feelings about it, too. I want what's best for you and everyone else, and while I do not use that as an excuse I do question. Do you really think everything in my life is perfect? Sometimes it feels like you think that I'm perfect, nothing has gone wrong for me, and I'm all fine and dandy. I never asked to put up with anyone's shit, but that just seems to be the case for me. I never once asked to put up with your shit, with all our friends shit, with my upperclassmen shit, but I just have endure. I put up with it because you're my family, because you're arguably one of my best friends. I'd like to make it clear that even though I can handle it well, I don't speak about it, I'm capable of stress too. I'm a fucking human. Getting yelled at by you constantly for things I didn't do, getting yelled at you as I try to help you, getting yelled at when you simply had a bad day. I'm honestly just tired. Not specifically of you, but just generally tired. I apologize about just dropping this on you, but I feel like some of this had to be said. I know you hate it when someone says this, but doing that, honestly you're acting like one of the people you mildly dislike more than you'd like to admit.(our grandmother)""

So let's call my best friend in the group Lily. She's basically one of the only unproblematic ones. She's part of a trio in that group with Sally and Stella. Sally is pretty problematic and she basically likes starting shit for no reason. There's also Hannah, who talks shit about a lot of people and sometimes is just really petty.

There's currently beef with them and Hannah to the point where Hannah doesnt talk to them and the trio shit talk them. I confronted lily about it and she claimed that Sally and Stella barely shit talk her even though they literally have a history of shit talking everyone. I told her that she should at least talk to them about it so it's not completely like a cold war type situation, but she basically said that everyone shit talks everyone and confronting them wont do anything. imo i feel like that doesn't justify anything and since she's close with them she should speak out instead of being a bystander. I kind of feel bad for telling her to talk to them because it feels like I'm putting a burden on her and she said that she doesn't have the energy to hold the group together, but I also think it's necessary because its a really toxic environment and we need more people to hold the toxic ones accountable. also i feel like if she even has the energy to be affiliated with them in the first place then she should also have the responsibility for calling them out when necessary, and if she's not willing to do that, she should distance herself from them. She told me that she doesn't want to ""advocate"" for Hannah cuz she's done some things to her as well, but still, what the trio say about her could literally be considered bullying so idk.. im pretty torn about this like idk if im being controlling or if im doing what's necessary so AITA?

356	226	adjudicated	TTA	"My SO and I were given a dog almost 2 years ago by family members (on my SO’s side). For context, they claimed they were getting too old to take care of him, couldn’t keep up with his 2-3x daily walks, on top of being too busy with traveling, as they tend to leave town for extended trips (about a month long). They are frequent travelers and would have neighbors watch the dog when they were out of town. We have heard that he wasn’t always properly cared for during these times, and the previous owners also said they had come back to their dog after a trip with his water bowl bone dry.

A few months into owning our dog, they asked to borrow him for a few days. We were understanding and allowed them to do so but only asked if his trip was 3 days instead of 5. Previous owners made a big issue of this saying we’re being selfish and difficult. We still allowed them to take our dog for the 3 days and got him back with no issue. However, this interaction had left a sour taste in our mouths for all future visits, due to the blatant insults we received over a simple ask. 

Every few months they ask to have him for about 2 days and we allowed them. This past June, we were out of town with our dog and they were upset they couldn’t take him. Now, they asked to have him again and we said no. The reason for this is I have anxiety and depression, my dog has become a lifesaver when it comes to my mental health and I get incredibly anxious/depressed without him. Also, the insults they throw at us any time we are reluctant to let them have him has given us a bad impression and only makes us want to say no even more. After telling them our reason, they said their adult daughter has been suffering with lupus and asked if I would rather have lupus or anxiety. That’s fair, and I feel for her but I also feel they completely disregarded my health concerns and my reasonings. They have become belligerent, telling us we are incredibly selfish, inconsiderate, and have no compassion. 

Although I feel for them and do feel bad for saying no, I am not okay with the hostility we have received since being given our dog and the complete disregard for our feelings and reasons. Additionally, we have said we’re fine with them seeing our dog for the holidays or family gatherings. Also for background, we are not close with these family members at all and maybe only see them once every year for Christmas. 

I just don’t understand how someone can voluntarily give their dog up then harass the new owners for visits and become incredibly rude if we don’t comply, regardless of being family or not. AITA?"

Last Sunday, someone read my flyer at the gym and called me. She told me she had a 30 yo daughter who really needs the lessons bc she has mental health issues and how her therapist recommended learning piano. Mom cried on the phone and it was pretty stressful for me because:

1. she asked for in person lessons because she thought her daughter would not understand what i would teach her if i taught her online, and that if daughter didn't, daughter's mental health issues would deteriorate.
2. she asked for my personal address after i reiterated multiple times that i only do online lessons. 

Naturally, this made me uncomfortable. I felt bad, so even though I really never wanted to, I agreed to give lessons to her. 

I'm also stressed about the repercussions of ending the lessons. The gym manager told/confirmed to them that I work out there. So does the daughter and her mom tags along for support ig.

I've been at this company for 25+ years and I am well loved and respected so I don't think I'll be let go, but who knows? I am the only source of income in my family. 

My daughter is 24 and seems stuck and lost in her career after being laid off 2 months ago, and my husband is 60 and doesn't work. He invests and has passive income, but I'm the only one with a real job and benefits.

My daughter said, ""Today, I decided I will go with Career Path 1, succeed in that career, get a good network, and save money, and then go back to school for 1-2 years for Career Path 2."" 

My husband said, ""No way does that schooling only take 1 year; it's gonna take at least 2. And when you are old, like 30 or 40, you don't learn as fast and won't have the stamina to keep up with the young people.""

Then my daughter and husband just started screaming at each other - my husband has a condescending tone when he talks, and it sets me off too.

I exclaimed to my daughter, ""What are you doing?"" She said, ""Oh you know I've done 13 interviews after I've been laid off even though I hate my career path.""

I don't know. I feel badly for my daughter but I don't have the money or bandwidth to support her. She just seems to have so many issues and no resolution.

Well after another 5 or 6 more times of failing she got really frustrated and slammed the controller on her leg and mashed the buttons pretty hard out of frustration. These were joycons, which are already very easy to break, but they were also limited edition ones that cost $150 for the set and we really don't have the money to replace them. I told her, ""Please don't disrespect them like that."" She got angry put the controllers on her chair and stormed off. 

We then spent some time in the morning doing our own things and then I tried to revisit the subject after she got out of the shower. I apologized for getting upset but tried to tell her that the controllers are fragile and can break easily. She responded with, ""When I game I have a tendency to throw my hands down in frustration, I do the same when I'm playing on pc and my hands slam into the keyboard."" I don't do that as the things I have are a bit expensive to replace. (Now that doesn't mean I haven't dropped my controllers unintentionally or they haven't fallen off my desk) I feel like I could've asked her a little nicer but  I don't like that she mashed the controller in frustration.

It is just me and my daughter (13) here and I was happy to help. He has his own room and I provide him meals - he buys his snacks. Jake has not hidden the fact that this was not his choice and has told me that my aunt made him move in with me. 


  
I didn’t ask for him to pay board to begin with as he was having a hard time emotionally and I didn’t know how long he would be here. The only thing I asked was that he keep the bathroom clean. He does not clean and it gets to the point where I have to scrub the pee of the floor myself. (He shares the bathroom with my daughter, but she has other chores and it’s not fair to ask her to do this too. I also know the mess my daughter makes, it is considerably more now). 

Jake also has no consideration for my house. Ex, he will leave his window wide open when he goes out and its pouring rain. I bring my concerns up to him and he will say throwaway things like “I was planning on cleaning later today”. I know they are basic issues but its constant and things I shouldn’t have to tell an adult. 


  
There is also the increased cost to me. I am a single parent and while I could support myself and my daughter ok, I am struggling with the extra costs. I couldn’t even afford to get my mother some flowers for her birthday this year and while I know she understands I still feel horrible. 

2.5 months ago I told Jake that I needed him to contribute. I did some research into reasonable board and took my own increased costs into account and decided $150pw. He said it was too much, I lowered it to $100pw. He paid that week but not the next 4. I brought it up he paid one week, then my aunt paid the next week. A week later she paid again but only half. Then nothing and no communication about it. I don’t want to have to chase up money every week. I know he has money as while he is a student he has a job and he also receives money from the government. I also think it is unfair that my daughter is missing out on things while I am having to cover the increased costs due to Jake being here.


  
Between the above and the attitude, (most days he will just grunt at me when I speak) I feel I am almost at breaking point. Me and my daughter now spend most of the time in our own rooms as I feel uncomfortable in my own house. 


  
I feel like I am being taken advantage of and want to ask him to leave (I would give him time). He can move back in with his family, he just doesn’t want to due to not getting along with his dad and he would have to share a room with his brother again. 

I’m also worried about the repercussions with my family. I know my immediate family will support me, but I am concerned that the rest of my family will be mad at me for asking him to leave. 

So WIBTA for asking him to move out?

I am at fault too tbh my recent grades were very concerning as we shifted 2 months ago so i had no time to prepare for tests properly.  
Apart from all this i have been trying to help mom out as well as keeping up with school, tuition and finishing my work timely. I am not sure what really she wants me to do anymore.

My grandmother is quite old and not all mentally there, so she mainly keeps to herself on the main floor, while I mind my own business in the basement. So with my dad’s okay (it’s his mother) I was allowed to have my own basement space rent free as long as I keep it neat and tidy. 

One thing I did to personalize it was print up some paintings to tape them on the wall. To be honest, I’m okay admitting I have some disturbing taste in art. I like medieval art depicting torture, demons, and all other stuff pertaining to human suffering. However I didn’t want anything too edgy to hang up, so I printed up some Francisco Goyas and Bosch’s I like.

However, things got fuzzy when my father’s youngest sister called me up a bit concerned about my art. She’s very into new age religious stuff; IE tarot cards, “mystic rocks”, “healing”, palm readings, astrology, etc. Honestly I think all of that is a crock of nonsense, but I don’t really want to say that to her face. 

She told me that because my art was pagan and dealing with “the devil”, it was going to send “negative” energy throughout the house, potentially put my grandmother in danger, and that I’m tampering with bad stuff. She then asked if I could kindly remove the paintings since it would be difficult for her to “cleanse the house” if I didn’t. I tried reassuring her that there’s nothing satanic about the art, but she didn’t really believe me. I then realized since I have the privilege of living in the basement rent free, I should just do as she asks. 

However, when I told my dad what happened he got kind of annoyed. My dad and his sister aren’t exactly on great terms, so he said it was my living space  and I can put up what I want in there. He then said since my grandmother hasn’t gone into the basement in almost a decade, it’s fine to keep them up since she’ll never see them. I feel like he might be right, but I also realize it’s not my house and I’m not paying a dime for the water, heating, living space etc. So WIBTA if I didn’t take down the printed paintings? I really don’t want to"

I get home give him his burger and he goes upstairs saying he has money upstairs. After I get ready to eat I knock on his door and ask him for the money. He kinda snaps and says he’s eating and doesn’t wanna touch the money. So I walk away. He calls my name and says to just grab the money. That should be the end of it right? But no. I wake up at 5:30am to get ready for work and I see he texted me twice. 

“It may not come with mustard but it certainly comes with a surcharge. A double double is $4. You overcharged me and demanded the money while I was eating. Weird. 

Texting me if I wanted in&out was a nice and good thing, you made it fucked up while demanding the money while I was on my second bite. Never touch money then eat, it is a pathway to explosive diarrhea. Money is usually dirtier then a toilet seat.” 

(He texted no mustard and I replied I don’t think it comes with mustard, and he said this at 4:30 hours after.. also his burger was $3.65 so I just rounded up to $4 cause I’m not a cash register)

I then texted him a picture of the receipt and that I didn’t want him to come in to my room while I was eating because he’s done it before and I just got home finishing chores and finally sat down to eat and didn’t want to be bothered. He said “so you come into my room” and I said you should have come down with the money like you said you would. 

I was texting him at 5:50 downstairs making coffee getting ready for work and he storms downstairs calling me an asshole “is this what you want?” And he throws in a crumbled $10 bill into the sink. I say ok and take it. He said no give me my money back. He continues to call me a dick and an asshole for asking him for money for his burger “you’re doing this for $4!?” He then goes upstairs mumbling to himself and I heard him say “no wonder (I don’t know what he said) yells at you” he then comes back down a minute later and we argue. He said “you do a nice thing but then fuck it up. I’m not mad for me I’m mad for other people you treat” I just then say “you’re right I’m sorry” just trying to end it but he keeps going on. I’ve just been getting anxiety over this whole conversation just boiling over and I tell him “it’s 5am and I’m trying to get ready for work so can you just let me do that??” He finally drops it and goes upstairs. I bring coffee up to my room and lock the door. He then comes over and knocks on my door apologizing “it’s a good thing you texted me if I wanted in n out. I feel bad cause you’re getting ready for work. I want to give you money” I deny his money and say it’s okay. 

I’m really starting to think my uncle is bipolar or something. He’s nice one minute and just explodes NY style the next. So AITA for asking him for money for his burger while he was eating after he said he would have the money ready when I got home?"
440	88	adjudicated	NAH	"Context: I'm an undergrad living in a house where some of my housemates are grad students. I'm on the second floor, and I come home around 1-2am semi-regularly (2-3 times per week).

However, because the house is rather old, the floorboards are creaky. So, even when I'm very gently walking around while preparing to sleep, noise travels down to the bedroom of the grad student below me.

The grad student has come up 2 times since the beginning of the year to tell me that he woke up because of noise coming upstairs from my bedroom.

I truly don't know what to do. After the first time he came up to complain, I'm walking as gently as I can and avoiding putting items down on the bare floor (on carpets instead). I'm also usually coming back from late-night study sessions or chill hangouts, so I'm never inebriated or rowdy.

The only thing I can change is how early I can head back to the house at night and go to sleep, which is a pretty large and interrupting lifestyle change."

I(16f) has a friend(16f) that celebrated her birthday on Saturday. 
My friend (we will call her L)  had her birthday on Saturday but my parents didn’t want me to go out. 
Me and L are friends since we were 6 and at midnight of course I wrote her happy birthday and all. At the actual day of the birthday she texted me and asked if I can come to her place to celebrate (me her and my boyfriend) because she didn’t want to be alone. 
Me and L have been going through everything together, depression, family deat/issues and the amount of time that we crashed at each others place was too big to count (she has a key to my house) my parents love her and her parents love me as well.  We both didn’t think we will get to celebrate our 16th. (She was at my party two months before) so we were really emotional and wanted each other there on our special day. 
I begged my parents to let me go and wrote to L that I’ll probably won’t be able to meet her but my dad let me go to her’s. 
Me and my boyfriend arrived at her house, the door was locked so my boyfriend texted her that he wanted to do a surprise for her and she wasn’t there so she told him to get the spare key and go inside.
We went inside and entered her room so we could put our things there but when we entered there were already people there. 

I consider L my close’s friend, when I entered the room I found out our other best friend (17f, let’s call her A) was there with two other friends and were planning a surprise for her, I didn’t know anything about it. Me, A and L have been a group of three Since 8th grade, she didn’t tell me she planned a surprise party for our best friend. Instead, she told E (a person that came to our group newly), H her boyfriend that I met her with and I, a friend that isn’t close to L at any way. 
She didn’t let me or my boyfriend know about the Suprise at all. 
I was hurt yet covered it with a smile even when E told me I’m a dumbass for coming when they were planning to Suprise L. 

We surprised L and everything was nice and she cried and hugged me and thanked me for coming even if my parents were mad at me We ate cake and smiled and sang songs and everything but I was still in a foul mood 

Why wouldn’t A let me know about the party? Later I talked to her and she said that she told me about it and I said I wouldn’t come. 

When we were the whole group together I found out they brought weed so they could all smoke together and E let out a rude comment 

“Now that you are here we probably won’t smoke it” I have a problem with drugs, my father is a recovering cancer patient and has a prescription for weed and my bf was going through quitting weed.

I asked if that’s the reason A and E haven’t told me about the Suprise party and it got silence; L didn’t know about the weed at all and also got irritated bcz A and E brought it and when she found out I wasn’t invited because of it she got mad and told A that I was her best friend and how the hell she didn’t invited me.

Me and my boyfriend got out and there ten minutes after. 

Our group chat has been quiet since and neither of the girls talk to me. 

I feel  like I screwed up. 

I don’t want to lose them as a friends.
What should I do?"
2	374	adjudicated	TTA	"I always wondered how people ended up in the situation they were in but I finally get it- also please let me know if i’m just being dramatic about this for if this is just not right?

A long backstory for you guys, I (f16) had been working at my job for a few months now. when I first applied there my step mom (f48) helped me file out my paper work with the banking statements. I was using my account they use to pay me when I work for her (she owns her own business). I have made a good chunk of money while working at this place. I get payed a little over minimum wage. I don’t work too much due to being a high-school student. 

this is the part that gets a little messy-I didn’t have my own credit card and I couldn’t see the bank account what so ever. I hadn’t taken money or put money in for a few months so when I had to take money out to pay my dad (m48) for “rent” (no clue if he uses it for rent or what he does with it, step mom said he is saving it for my college but idk) there was only around $1,500 dollars in there. I should have had around $3,000. when I had brought it up with my step mom she realized that she and my father had been pulling money from that account.

my parents are kinda know for taking my money and using it (for whatever they use it for) my dad had just told me he took $500 for bills and a few years ago he did the same for a few other things. (ne never asks he just takes) not only this he is currently unemployed while my step mom is working 2 jobs. My bio mom (f46) helped me get a new bank account set up since my step nine as too busy. my stepmom gave me $2000 to start it. My mom knows all about how they take money from my bank account. 

When I asked my stepmom again for the rest of my money she said that $2000 was probably all I had left because of all the spending I do. I don’t spend money like that. I go out maybe once a month with my friends and we go do a little shopping but most the time I use my cash I make from my other job. (I work two jobs in the winter time) she then argued with me about this saying $2000 was plenty. I got mad and left. she later texted me saying that we will figure out how much I am owed. it had been almost 2 months since then. I decided to do the math by myself, which isn’t completely accurate but at this point I don’t care. turns out i’m about at the very least another $3000. So WIBTH if i asked for it back??"
333	28	adjudicated	YTA	"Almost a year ago I got my best friend a Nintendo Switch and a $60 game for Christmas because I new they really wanted one but couldn't afford it. We had been best friends and pretty close for over a year now and I had the extra money. Then about a week into the new year (this year) they started ghosting me out of no where. Cutting me out of their life, forcefully. I tried to keep in contact, but about a month went by and they just went completely silent on me. For extra context we live in the same apartment building and go to the university and co-lead a club on campus so we would see each other often, but last semester they stopped showing up until the last 2-3 weeks. Since I because I knew their schedule I purposely avoided them. Around the end of the semester we started talking a bit more again and have been more this semester but they are starting to ghost me again. Not as extreme but it's happening. (There are other details I am purposely leaving out but I do not think they are important to the main question I want an opinion on. Mosty other drama.)

When it started happening, one thing that stuck with me was I got my bestfriend the Switch, not a friend, and after all the drama, this person is no longer my bestfriend, just a friend. I debated asking for the Switch back, but I never did because they already got games for it and use it kinda frequently. Well it's getting close to a year and with them starting to ghost me again, I am starting to question myself if I should ask for it back. But with how long it's been, I wonder if it's worth it or if I should just take the loss? 

I know I can explain why I would want it back, but I feel it's just going to lead to argument and them resenting me. But I also kinda don't care how they feel anymore. They shut me out like the past year was nothing and then tried to resume our friendship like nothing happened months later. Would I be the asshole if I asked to get the Switch back?

70	352	adjudicated	NAH	"For context: my girlfriend lives away from her parents and since I’m a masters student I now live back with mine. I’m half caucasian half Middle Eastern (far more brown than white though) and she is caucasian. We have been dating for over half a year now and a month or two ago I met her family at a gathering. All was going well until we went back to their house with some extended family and while all cracking jokes her dad said to me “I heard you might have a gun on you?” To which I said “who told you that?” 

My GF wasn’t in the room and her two cousins were with us and told him to stop being an asshole, which stopped it all there. After my girlfriend returned I told her the weird incident and didn’t really think too much into it… she then took me somewhere private and told me that when we first started dating she was telling her family all about me at another gathering and her father said “oh yeah how’s that Ni***r of yours getting on?” Apparently the whole family was shocked and just stayed silent for a few minutes.

I obviously felt very uncomfortable and unsafe in that house but kept trying to understand why it was said and prompted her further… she told me that he said he liked me in the bar and that she thinks he’s very ignorant and that he’s very uneducated (didn’t finish school and works as a trade). As someone who studied psych I get this and understand that racism is learnt not innate.

After that incident I said I’m not comfortable being there and don’t plan on going to her families house again for a long time. I was even tempted splitting up and openly had a conversation about this with her because my kids are going to be mixed race and that is the grandfather they’re ultimately going to have. Upon reflection I also recall her sister and one of her cousins asking at random points of the night “I see you met *the dad*, how was that?” And I said “yeah it was fine, why?” To which they both went “oh, he’s just very awkward like”.

Fast forward to today and she’s saying she wants me to go to her family house at some point over the Christmas but I am opposed to being in the same room as her dad never mind staying under his roof. She said it was a bit unfair and that’s quite one sided since she’s thinking of potentially moving home. I told her I’d make the effort to travel to wherever closest to her but just not anything to do with her dad. She has since apologised and said she didn’t mean to pressure me and it’s completely understandable to not want to go to her parents house but that it’s upsetting.

Obviously in an ideal situation I’d more than love to go to my girlfriend’s parents house for Christmas to socialise with siblings and what not. However, given the circumstances I really feel uncomfortable doing so. I’m not looking to validate my feelings but am I being irrational or should I just suck it up and maybe avoid him at family gatherings and hope he becomes less ignorant?"
209	358	adjudicated	NAH	"Myself (M) and the girlfriend have been together for a good few years now. She is taller than me by about 4 inches and I was a relatively short and skinny lad whereas she was more on the bigger side.

When we first met, she wasn’t fat (not using the word as a demeaning or insult btw), just a bit on the bigger side.

As time has gone on, i too have gained a bit of a belly (whilst also gaining a temperamental acid reflux), whereas because of her mental health and medication, she has gained a few stones (more so recently) and is currently the biggest she has ever been (her words).

My potential fuck-up:
We have been through a bit of a rough patch a lot recently, and a problem that was brought up was our sax life and how minimal it has become. I mentioned how we have our growing differences in shapes and that i want her to be happy and healthy within herself, but also wanted to say that i am struggling with it. I mentioned how the acid reflux effects it and tried broaching the topic as gently as possible whilst trying to aim the problem being more myself rather than her weight, but maybe i said the wrong thing or shouldn’t have said it at all.

I understand talking about weight is a very tough subject, especially someone with mental health issues, but i did not want to lie or pretend that everything is ok.

This was a few days ago, she told me last night how mad she is with me for it and for basically calling her fat and that i should love her or find her attractive whatever her physical differences are, which is a fair point.

63	483	adjudicated	NAH	"Hello, reddit. I (32m) have three sons (9, 8, & 6). This post is about the youngest, Joshua (6m). Sadly, we lost my ex-wife at the end of 2022. We had been separated for years, but we were still good friends and co-parents. I also ended a long term relationship in early 2023, and both of my old cats had to be put down this year, so my mental health has been pretty awful all year. It is fair to say that, without my ex-wife's kindness and support, I have been struggling a lot. I feel constantly exhausted and alone, having basically no time to myself and I constantly feel like I am doing everything wrong. My family knows this, but only make it worse, constantly comparing me to my sisters (34f & 29f) and their lives/families. 

Joshua turned 6 at the beginning of November. Usually, for their birthdays my ex-wife would have arranged a big party, either at the local pool or sports centre, or in her garden, and invited all of their friends from school, football, rugby, drama etc. I already felt spread too thin between home and work and knew I would not be capable of arranging all of that. Instead, my sister and I took my sons, their cousins, and 3 friends of Joshua's choice to the cinema. We also looked around a few shops, bought some doughnuts from a kiosk, and got pizza on the way home. The children all seemed to have a great time, and while I knew it was nothing to the standard of what my ex did, I thought everything was fine.

 However, over the past week, both my parents and my ex-in-laws have been contacting me asking when Joshua's party was or if they hadn't been invited this year. I explained that there was no big party this year, just a day out, but he had received all their cards/presents and we'd be writing thank you cards to send out soon. Both my parents and my ex-in-laws were furious by this, saying the boys always had big parties and it was unfair that my cousins were having them and they did not - which is not wrong, my sister's twins had a big party over the summer that we attended, and my ex's stepbrother and his wife always throw big events for their children. 

 I initially thought I hadn't done anything wrong, but both my father and my ex-FIL remain convinced that I am setting my sons up to feel inferior and that they aren't worth my effort, and my ex-FIL and his wife and considering throwing Joshua a party of their own, which I would not even be allowed to attend. I of course would never want any of my children to feel like that and now feel like a dick considering my sons obviously remember the parties their mother used to throw and I do not want them to think I love them less. My eldest is turning 10 at the end of december and I do not want to get it wrong again, so AITA for not throwing my son a proper birthday? Should i have put more effort in?"
384	463	adjudicated	ESH	"Where I live, before going to university we have to do a job called ""research work"" which would basically be a university job but simpler.
This work can be on any topic we want, but it must have a theoretical part and a practical part. (hypotheses are raised and they have to be tested to draw conclusions). This work is very important because it counts for 20% of the final grade.

The thing is that they have forced us to do the work in pairs, and I have done it with my friend. But, he hasn't done anything. Let me explain what the job entailed and what exactly I did.

In our work we analyze neural networks (computer programs, so to speak) and compare another one from Google with one created by an AI. And on the other hand, the creation of another Neural Network that generates images through trial and error functions (in our case, it ""learned"" to make handwritten numbers).

The thing is that I have done everything that required programming (almost all the content) and I also did a large part of the writing.

An older friend told me that I should report that I have done a lot to get a higher grade than my friend (who has done nothing). Although I know it would be selfish of me.

Finally, I want to add that this work has cost me approximately 4 and a half months.

93	324	adjudicated	YTA	"**Context:** My dog chewed 2 of her rugs on separate occasions 1 year ago when we lived separately. Both times were at night we believe, and both items were rugs but the damage was minimal. My dog was around 1 at the time and this wasn't typically where she slept. In my home, she never chewed anything, not even a shoe. Fast forward a year later (Dog is over 2 now) and while in the dog's crate, she had wrecked her bed (Which I paid for). This happened only once, and was on a day when I didn't have time to walk her, and we caged her up when we left to an event (She usually isn't caged up during the day in the crate). Those are the only instances where the dog has destroyed any furniture that I am aware of.

**Current Situation:** My girlfriend took off with her dog for the long weekend. Typically the dogs (hers and mine) sleep in a separate room where mine is in a crate. However, without company, my dog will cry at night when in her crate and this disrupts my sleep. I decided to remove the rugs in the room and put the dog's bed in my room with me. 3 nights, no issues. Just a little dog waiting for me to wake up patiently even though I had slept in twice. This was the case in my old place for 2 years as well. She never even peed in a room with me in it during the puppy phase.

However, 1 week ago my girlfriend was really pissed at me. We determined the problem was that I hadn't replaced the things my dog had 'destroyed' 1 year ago (the small tears were barely noticeable, but my girlfriend is a *very* neat and tidy person, and these are her things, so I am trying to empathize now) and living together brought that all back. I apologized as the problem was that I had never offered which I felt bad about, and we got past that. I told her I was willing to replace all things and I am financially capable of doing so thankfully. The week after was great and she seemed happy again and less resentful to my dog (that was a thing for a long time despite the damage being done a year ago). 

She came in this morning after I had cleaned the place. She asked how my dog was at night, and how she slept in the crate. I told her that she slept in the room with me and she immediately got upset. She told me about how untrustworthy my dog is, and how it's like I don't listen to her, and we had a very quiet ride to work. I snapped back and called her paranoid, and reiterated that I would replace things if it ever happened again and that my dog has proven herself countless times. However I feel that I fucked up, but at the same time I feel like I took the precautions and my dog not destroying anything was the result. I feel bad about not listening to her, and I probably should have moved the crate, but there is no room to even put it in the room and moving it would be an ordeal with our tight space living situation. We have therapy in about a week, and I feel this will be a point that will come up. But people of Reddit, AITA?"

My mom has it pretty rough right now. She has full custody of my siblings and my dad is doing everything he can to avoid paying child support. He convinced her to quit her job a couple months before she found out he cheated and she doesn’t have any family in the area. Right now we’re in a 2 bedroom house and she sleeps on the couch. I’m doing everything I can to help. I work and I pay $400 a month in rent and I give her my gas cards and grocery gift cards from school ($50 and $100 a month). She splits my car insurance with me but I’m trying to get her to let me pay all of it. I honestly feel responsible for us being in this situation. I knew my dad was cheating but he bought me a really nice car, new phone, iPad, headphones, and whatever else I wanted and he tripled my allowance and he promised to pay for my college as long as I didn’t tell her. I let it go on for over a year and didn’t start to drop hints until I found out she quit her job. She says she’s not mad at me but I’ve been trying to give her space. 

I was taking 19 credits this semester, the most my school allowed. I was taking English, communications, an early childhood education class, anatomy, and chemistry. I know it was dumb but my job needs me to take the ece class and everything else is required for my major. The problem is I kept falling really behind in English. It got to a point where I had to drop it. The thing is my mom was an AP English lit/lang teacher. She really is qualified to help me with my work. I never asked tho. 

When I told her I dropped English because I fell behind, she looked really disappointed and asked why I never asked for help. I told her she’s really busy with my siblings and working and I’m trying to give her space because of everything that happened. Now she’s checking in with me a lot more and asking to check my homework and see if I need any help and I know she won’t admit it but I’m pretty sure she’s mad at me for dropping the class instead of asking her for help.

Since I take the overnight shift in preparing bottles, we have an arrangement that Part will take the morning shift, change diaper, feed morning bottle, watch Child until Nanny arrives at 8:15am. 

Last 2 days, Child has been running a fever (>101F), and has a runny nose. This morning, Child woke up again unwell. Ate 4 bottles overnight. I asked Part to remove Child from bed at ~7:04am as Child was up anyways. I replace earplugs, try to sleep. I hear Child begin to cry, then progress into guttural heaves. We have monitors at home. I can see Part is in office and ignores Child. I come out asking why Part isn't comforting Child, given that they're very young and unwell. Part explains that Child ""needs to learn that crying won't get [their] way."" I respond that Child is 18m and feverish/unwell and has a poopy diaper (I was wrong, they farted) and now is not the right time to teach this lesson. Part asks when the right time is. I respond not now. Child continues to cry and heave.

I ask Part to change the diaper while I snot-suck Child's nose. I attempt to return back to bedroom to sleep. Child acts afraid of Part, so Child sits in front of bedroom, and cries for me. I come out, tell Part they need to spend time with Child otherwise I am the only ""safe parent"" and I won't be able to rest. Part responds with: ""He takes, you take, all I ever do is give."" Part breaks the babygate in a rage and scares Child so much, they begin to dry heave and screech into my shirt. I also begin to cry out of exhaustion and emotion.

Part believes Child is crying to manipulate, and should be ignored, especially after being told ""no."" I believe Child is 18m and still  practicing emotional regulation, and should not be left to cry until they are heaving. I believe Child should be redirected to another task. Part is frustrated that there is no sleep training happening at night. I am frustrated that Child is, in fact, sleep trained, but is generally a poor eater and so eats formula at night to makeup for bad eating during day. 

Part has more W2 income, and I have more assets which generate income. I currently do not work a W2. 5 days ago, I had a minor operation to deal with a chronic pain illness, I am still recovering and can't move well. We have a general agreement that I care for the child's play, stimulation, feeding, nonphysical care. Part will handle diapers, bath time, physical care. 

Part wants to know when it's okay to let Child cry it out. Part says I use the excuse too often of: he's too young. My stance is: it's okay to let Child whine and cry, but not okay to let Child escalate to full on tantrum, dry heaving, etc without redirecting and trying to regulate Child's emotions. We are the adults, we teach Child how to regulate. Ignoring Child will only escalate the situation.

From day one, Sam has put limits on my writing that she doesn't apply to the other students in the program. She has talked about how approachable she is and how she can be trusted without really showing it, including asking me why I have official documentation for my disability when she felt I could have just asked her for accommodations.

It may be me overthinking, but I ended up asking Jane to meet with me to discuss my progress and if I should be doing things differently. Jane and I talked about my work and if I felt I was getting the support I needed. I mentioned the comment from Sam and how I wanted to ask for clarification, but found her intimidating, as when I had previously asked for help she wasn't very helpful.
  

  
For example, we had a paper due and I emailed Sam about the formatting, noting that the syllabus talked about subject matter, but not format, and she pointed me back at the syllabus more than once. Since Jane had worked with Sam for a while, I figured she might have some advice on the best way to approach Sam and share my concerns. Jane then offered to email Sam to set up a time for Sam and I to meet and discuss.
  

  
An hour after Jane sent the email, Sam emails me that she wants to clear something up, asking to talk to me on the phone. She calls me, and starts talking about how “betrayed” she felt that I talked to her colleague, that I embarrassed her and she doesn’t understand why I wouldn’t just talk to her. When I said I find her intimidating she responds that “that’s a \[me\] problem.” I tried to tell her that I want to be a good student and impress her with my writing, and she says “that’s bullshit.” She says I am her “most difficult student” and I’m “asking for too much” and I mention I’m autistic and have additional needs, and she responds that I “need to stop using autism as an excuse.” 
  

  
After 20 minutes, I tell her I need to get off the phone because I’m headed into work and she ends by saying I “need to stop blaming others for \[my\] problems and take accountability”. 
  

  
I can see how Sam might be upset that I talked to her colleague, but I went to Jane asking for advice because I didn’t know how to approach Sam, which I feel like isn’t that out of the norm, and she offered to bridge the conversation for me, so I took her up on that offer. But I keep replaying that phone conversation in my head and wondering, AITA?

My boyfriend of 10 years has been there for me for all this - visited me at the hospital, drive me to places when I wasn't confident taking public transportation, all the acts of service. However, I feel like he acts like his life has not changed at all. He continues to get regular drinks with this friends (friends that I used to hang out too pre-tumor) every week 2-3 times a week, and when I say go out I mean come back at 2-3am, not light drinks. 

I'm bitter that he can he still do this, but more bitter at the fact that he still feels like doing this while I'm basically depressed at home trying to deal with the cancer. I feel he provides very little emotional support, and the fact that he is completely fine in continuing the nights out while I'm suffering has turned me so so bitter.

The trip was really great, and near the last few days we discussed going to hot springs (Onsen) near where we were staying. We took the trip with our two kids (9F and 13M), and didn’t know how they would like the idea. At hot springs in Japan, you are almost always required to be fully naked, and since you’re walking around and washing up like that there’s pretty much zero-privacy. This isn’t a problem for them since it’s just the culture. 

We didn’t know how our two American children would feel about going to a place like that. We discussed it with them, and right away our daughter said no. My son, however, said he wanted to go. So on the second last day we let our daughter stay at the hotel for the second half of the day, while the rest of us headed to the Onsen. 

When we got there we headed into the locker room and I started to change. When I was naked, I looked over and saw that my son had swim trunks on. I was confused, as I had explained what was going on. He told me that he didn’t want to go in naked, since it would be too embarrassing etc. I told him to just take it off and with some prodding he did. It was too late to take him back to the hotel, and I felt it was his own fault for not listening to me if he was embarrassed. 

The son seemed pretty traumatized at the beginning, definitely not comfortable with being naked in front of me and a bunch of strangers. We spent a couple hours there, and he seemed to be more relaxed by the end. Once we got back to the hotel he seemed upset and at me and when I told my wife what happened she took his side. She thought I should’ve gotten dressed and driven him back or something. 

I didn’t think I had done anything wrong, since I had explained everything beforehand. Should I have been more clear, or just driven him back no matter what? AITA?"
415	309	adjudicated	NAH	"This year my family decided to start a messenger group to discuss what people want for xmas.  We each post links to things we would like, someone says what they're going to buy for so and so -- this way, everyone knows what everyone else wants, and we can figure out who's gifting what to who. My aunt just got upset because, to her understanding, we were suppose to each message one another on our own, to tell eachother what we are giving to each person. Not only would that be tedious, but that also means each of us would need to let the others know individually, if what they planned on gifting has already been chosen. In doing it this way, we ""ruin the surprise."" 

&#x200B;

The youngest person in the group is 29, and none of us care about being surprised. Truth be told, most of us don't even care to give gifts anymore, but we do it because in past years where we discussed not giving gifts, or only buying for one person each, or donating toys to tots, she's made a stink about it -- because ""it just wouldn't be Christmas without gifts."" I told her that it would be too complicated and a hassle for some (( grandparents, less internet/computer savvy )) and..((possible asshole moment!)) that we're all adults -- the surprise isn't all that important, is it? I then apologized and said she's entitled to her opinion, and I'm sorry if the surprise is ruined. I think what I said may have been a little insensitive, but it's the truth. Personally, I find the gift giving part of xmas to be the actual least important part of the holiday, but to each their own.

Prior to this year, we've always gotten presents for each other and my niece and nephew since they've been around the last 4 years. Christmas always gets way too expensive, especially since I have my own romantic partner to shop for as well.

In our family groupchat my brother  who just got married to us all he just wants to set the expectation that his step kids are equal parts of the family and he expects us to get them gifts this year as well. From a moral standpoint- fair enough I guess- but that just makes this even more expensive. Its been slowly getting more expensive as my niece and nephew get older but its kinda fun to get them presents and at least that was slowly building. For this, they're nice kids but I dont feel love for them and its just 3 new ones all at once. I suggested this year we just switch to a secret santa format, pull names and each just get a gift for someone plus parents can get stuff for their own kids.

One of my siblings chimed in saying we should do that as well, the 3 extra gifts were just too much for him, and he agrees its gotten out of hand. Well Jack took that as an opportunity to say were being assholes to his kids by excluding them. I said we would keep them in the Secret Santa group so they wouldnt be excluded, I just didnt want to spend another say $60 on them.

Its caused a hole thing where im getting called cheap by some of them and an AH by Jack. I just feel like its making christmas more if a stressor than a fun holiday and at this point Id like to just opt out."
72	277	adjudicated	NAH	I was really really good friends with this one girl. We talked every single day, FaceTimed like crazy. She was my absolute best friend. Unfortunately, she’s married to a narcissist who has put his hands on her, not to mention she’s got a baby by him. She recorded how he talked to her, took pictures of the marks he left on her, so all I could really do is be there for her when she needed it. She ended up changing passwords on everything and taking her husband off everything. I told her she had to get her and the baby out of that situation before it’s too late. When they had gotten evicted, she was gonna go stay at a family members house until she could get a car and an apartment but she and her husband “had” to move back into his mothers house (his mom knows what goes on n their marriage and still condones his crappy behavior, including the fact how she told my friend she was “delusional”) her reasoning was that she just needed a car. She gets more depressed and it makes me feel even more awful because I couldn’t do anything about it. I told her she needed to get out of there. But her husband went through her messages and made her block me on everything. I got mad because of the way he talked about me so I confronted him about his behavior and he sent his bs paragraph then blocked me. I’m almost 100% sure she got mad because she even blocked my other spam accounts just in case she needed me. It has been a month since I spoke to her last. I’m thinking I should linger and be there for her so she isn’t alone if she were to need help. At the same time, I don’t stick around in situations I’m not needed in. I’m trying not to sound self centered or anything but this hurts and it really feels like I lost her. Am I wrong in this? I really need opinions and advice.
182	404	adjudicated	NAH	"This past week my wife and I have been running around a lot with family obligations. We have had to take my youngest daughter to soccer practice and older daughter to field hockey practice. We had other events at night for our work and have been much like two ships passing in the night. 

 Earlier this week my wife asked if we could go out on Saturday night. I told her that sounded like a great idea and I was looking forward to it. We have neighbors next door to us who have a daughter around our daughter's age and our families are friends. We often invite them over for dinner or we will hang out at their house for some drinks. We're good friends. 

 My wife will often invite those neighbors over on a Friday night and tell me that she did so the day of. She will also invite other friends of ours over to the house or to go out to dinner with us or after the movies with us and it's always an addition to our evening. 

Sometimes I was not planning on hanging out with other  people but that's okay I'm not worried about it, it's fun. 

 On Friday night I was at an event for my daughter's school and I ran into our neighbors who were there. I asked them if they wanted to hang out this weekend, they said yes. I said that we were planning on going out to dinner on Saturday night and wondered if they wanted to join us. They expressed interest in that and we left it at that. 

The neighbor texted my wife on Saturday, and commented about going out. My wife sent me a text asking me about whether or not I had invited them and I told her that I did. 

My wife proceeded to get very upset and ask me why I would invite other people on our date. She said that she felt like she wasn't enough on the date and that I needed other people there to have fun. I do not see it as the case, I see it as just an additional level of fun to a night that we were going to have out. Similar to her inviting someone over to the house or out to the movies or out to dinner with us previously....it's something she has done in the past and i believed was fine.

I told my wife that I misunderstood the level of desire to spend time just the two of us that she had. We did not argue about it...we just went back and forth on it for a while. 

My wife was very upset about it. She eventually got over it, but it was several hours of her being hurt and angry. To me, it felt like she was misrepresenting my desires (in her words: that she isn't enough so I needed others) and getting upset with me for feeling a way I did not. 

My actions, yes, she can be upset. My intentions, they were good....I wanted to add to the night and have fun together. 

AITA for inviting our friends along for date night?"
131	113	adjudicated	NAH	"I (17F, soon to be 18) wants to eat out at a rather fancy restaurant for my 18th birthday.

 The average main dish costs about $40, which is a sizeable amount of money in my country, and not including appetisers, drinks, and other similar items. I've estimated that for the three of us (parents and me), it would cost somewhere around $180 - $220 in total.

For perspective, the average cost of a meal that we eat here is perhaps $5-7 dollars per person, and when we eat out at a rather nice Japanese restaurant, it costs about $25 for all three of us.

My parents are relatively well off, and my father is thinking of purchasing a car that costs about $83,000, to put in scale their financial position. However, they are quite frugal and, my mother especially, likes to purchase clothes second hand. If we went, it would also be my first time eating at a restaurant that expensive.

Hence, WIBTA if i ask my parents to eat there?"
410	161	adjudicated	NAH	My son is almost 2 who has delays in speech and cognitive. Now he’s a VERY independent toddler. He can communicate what he wants by pointing and showing me what he wants. Anyway he was playing with one of those flip the flap books. Just for context he likes to be in control when reading 📖. His uncle by marriage saw him playing with it and decided to interact with him. Well his uncle was trying to control how my son was reading it. There’s one flap he didn’t understand on how to properly open it. It was a sideways flap and he was trying to open it with his hand on the top and pulling sideways. His uncle then removed my sons hand from the flap thinking he was trying to rip (he wasn’t I had read that book earlier and he never once tried to rip it)which upset my son who thought he was taking it away from him. Which his uncle did and in a passive aggressive tone said you can’t play with it if you’re going to ripe it buddy. I don’t take books away from my son as a punishment either.
193	272	adjudicated	NAH	"Both friend and I are 30s m.Over the past year, friend (M) and I have gotten into a few big blow up arguments, mostly revolving around an issue regarding intent, impact, and responsibility. He believes that the onus of communication and understanding is on the listener as mistakes will always happen, and if a miscommunication happens, the listener needs to ask for clarification and clear things up. I agree with this partially -- obviously clarifying intent is important --, but I also believe the onus is on the speaker to take responsibility for their words even after clarification.

But I can't come to him over miscommunications because M has issues with me questioning his intent. For instance, if I ask him if he meant something by what he said, he gets offended that I'd ever suggest that he'd think/say that in the first place. Or if he did say something questionable, he thinks I should assume his intent was innocent, so asking for clarification means I view him as the type of person who would say that, and that's a problem for him.  If I assume what he means, I'm questioning his intent. If I ask what he means instead of jumping to conclusions, I'm questioning his intent. I'll say something like, ""hey, that seems hurtful, are you angry with me or is this a joke I'm not understanding or something?"" and in response I'll get called out for questioning his intent or not taking criticism or something. For the record, I do not agree with this; I believe you hold responsibility for the things you say even if you meant well. 

This has been the topic of our big blow ups and I'm exhausted.Recently, the topic came up again and that's when I set the boundary. I said I don't want to argue about this anymore (this being the topic of intent). This would be our fifth argument about this exact subject. I understand his view point, but I don't like it and I'm not going to sit there and argue the same points again.

This then blew up a bit where I assured him the boundary wasn't an admonishment of him or anything, I'm just trying to limit my arguments. He then said my boundary was shitty and got extremely passive aggressive saying things like, ""glad our entire relationship can be based on shitty communication. Looking forward to it."" Where I told him to just go to sleep and we'll talk later. We have talked since and it did not go well.

The intent argument has been putting stress on our friendship for the last year, and I placed the boundary knowing I couldn't take much more of it. But it seems doing so may have been the last nail in the coffin. M has taken me not wanting to have the intent argument to me not wanting to communicate issues anymore at all, but that's not true. The whole reason I reached out to have the 4 hour conversation was so we *could* communicate. I feel so strongly about placing this boundary, but with the way he responded, I'm wondering if I was the asshole for trying to set it in the first place."
55	55	adjudicated	TTA	"Obligatory apology for length and formatting, I'm on mobile.

So for backstory, my little sister (22f) and me (24f) grew up in a very unstable environment, not the greatest parental situation. 
 
After basically being kicked out at 18 (I had to be out asap and ended up in temporary housing), I still saw her almost every week.  

And then I got sick. For months it was a mystery as to why I was constantly in excruciating pain, and the support from my family was entirely missing, basically unless I came to them, I barely saw them.

I spend days stuck in my bed, alone, crawling to the bathroom because walking hurt too much. 

On bad weeks I didnt eat anything but non-perishables because if I walked downstairs from my bedroom to get food from the fridge or cook, the pain would be so debilitating that I would have to sleep on the couch that night in the hopes I'd have enough strength in the morning to get back upstairs. 

On my good weeks, when I could actually be out of the house, I'd spend nights at her place.
I shared some of the struggles with her, but would keep the heaviest details to myself, as most of the time, my pain got made light off by both her and my parents.

Our shared weekly plans fell through more and more as I got weaker and weaker, until I finally got a diagnosis, got treatment and started the road to a healthy body again. 

Only for my little sister to casually mention one day a couple of weeks after my diagnosis that both she and my parents thought I was faking my pain up until my diagnosis. 

And as much as I tried to leave that behind, it still haunts me that I was going through physical hell and even my little sister didn't believe me, and thought that it was okay to just casually mention this. 

Contact became less after this, but not non-existent. 

At 21 years old, and after multiple last straw attempts at reconciliation, I cut contact with my mother completely. 

This put a strain on the entire family, but was honestly the single best thing I ever did for myself. 

However, because I was starting to unpack a lot of things about our past, I became a lot more harsh on my mother and while it would've probably been better to keep this away from my sister, we ended up discussing these things often when we spoke. 

We clashed, she had forgiven my parents for everything and tried to justify their actions any time anything came up, while I was very much still unraveling all the stuff that wasn't okay growing up and angry about the choices my mother made. She told me she didn't want to discuss the past anymore, so that's where we left that. Contact was low but semi regular.

Then, I became sicker again. Even though the original illness was resolved, the physical decline of not being able to move for most of the 9 months I spend undiagnosed started a chain reaction that I'm still trying to catch up on. 

With that comes a ton less energy. I once again, most days cannot be outside of my home because walking is near impossible some days. 
When I started getting worse, my contact with the outside world once again declined, and most attempts at contacting me fell flat because I was honestly too ill to hold conversation. And while I told my little sister that I was physically doing worse and worse, and that I was trying but unable, contact fizzled out again. 

Texts every so often, calls that usually ended up coming on bad illness days while I was sick in bed so they didn't last more than a couple of minutes because I was too sick to think.... 

I honestly wish I had had more energy to be a sister, but I didn't have enough energy to even function most days. 


Then, when things went south with my mother's health earlier this year, my sister took off work and went to stay with my parents to support them.  

By the time my mother died, she had been in the hospital for over a month, and my sister had been there by her side for a few weeks, although I don't know the exact timeline as I was not told anything. 

A few days before her death, I got informed she was in the hospital and very unlikely to survive, but I declined to go see her, and told my sister I would travel up to see her and my dad if she didn't make it.

And that's what happened. She passed two days after I got the call she was sick. 

Tensions were high around the funeral, everyone was grieving and some fights happened that could've been avoided with better communication from both sides but I guess wouldn't have been relationship ending, except for one thing. 

I cut my mother off because she was a very manipulative woman that honestly caused way more harm than good in my life, and after spending a long time around her, my little sister started showing very similar behavior after the funeral.  

I tried really hard to be supportive, but when every interaction you have with a person becomes something you have to deeply unpack because they somehow turn everything into a flaw of yours, when the jokes you've been telling them for a decade were not okay get thrown around again even after telling her that this is not funny and to stop... 

It's really hard to supportive of a person who seems to want to break you down when she doesn't feel well, and that person is actively grieving.

After the funeral and couple of weeks spend with our dad (aprox. 5 months ago) we saw eachother once when visiting family.
After our visit, we were waiting on transport to our respective houses, and while we were waiting she started judging my way of pain relief while implying that I did not need it. 

I kept my cool, I said goodbye when she got to her stop, got home and broke down. I honestly stopped reaching out first which was on me, but this situation just was the straw that broke the camels back.  

I honestly didn't mean to ghost her at first, when she texted me, I wanted to open them but to be honest, besides from my S/O's texts (who I live with so very low effort texts) I didn't open any texts because there was no room for anything in my life but survival, as I've been having major flare-ups for months now. 

This went from one text, to two, to a bunch of them, to a very loaded one with heavy feelings of anger and frustration towards me. Telling me how she has been going through a rough time and health scares and that she needed me, that she now does want to talk about our past again.

I'm at a point in my life where I'm finally putting myself first after a childhood full of neglect and everything being more important than my needs. 

I am not in any space to be of any help, especially not when the person asking for help completely forgets the fact that I'm still 24/7 quite extensively disabled, and still declining.

In the time between the funeral and us leaving our parental home, she constantly belittled my pain, insinuated that I was overreacting when it came to my symptoms because of the fact that they fluctuate, took out her grief on me, and judged me very openly on every measure I took to make my illness more liveable. 
She was mean to me after our mother's funeral, she judged me for the ways I wanted to help my dad when he fell apart after our mother's death but also judged him for falling apart.

Eventually, when the emotionally loaded message came in, I made a conscious decision to not respond for my own well-being and hers. 

I cannot currently make enough energy to properly address this with her, and even if I could, I'm not sure I would anymore at this point. 

She is asking for the same support I so desperately needed when I was sick, alone in a house in the middle of nowhere, but didn't get because they didn't believe me. 

And that, while actively once again, ignoring the fact that I've been completely disabled by illness to the point I cannot take care of myself, my partner has to take care of me. 

So reddit, Am I the asshole for ghosting my little sister?"

Prior to this, l've told him that I wanted to take things slow, have fun but ultimately I'm looking for a relationship, his replies were always ""let's see were things goes"".
Anyways, after that moment, he started to become distant with me, he said that he was feeling sick and needed some space. One of my friends is a nurse and was able to get me into an emergency IUD just in 2 days which I'm happy about. I then asked that when he was ready that we could meet and talk about what he wanted moving forward. He then told me that he was mentally not ready to be in a relationship and wanted to focus on himself first but wanted to continue hanging out, etc.
I took his word and thought that he wanted to just string me along and left him and told him that my intentions have been clear from the start, he wished me the best.

We went no contact for about 2 months and he messaged to talk, he said he saw me at a party, and waved but I ignored him. He then apologised for how he handled things, and said that he did want a relationship but wanted to get to know me well first especially since we only been on 3 dates and things went fast. To be fair I wasn't the most active during our dating phase either, I had work 6 days a week and barely texted and called understood his POV. So I apologised for being harsh, he then started to message me a lot like it used to be but obviously I'm skeptical. I decided to out of the blue ask if we could just be friends instead, he seemed rather upset but agreed. A month later he saw me on TINDER and asked what I was doing on it? I gave him very little information.


He then asked if we could grab lunch, during the lunch he would constantly ask about my dating life while also talk about how worried he is for this ""girl"" and that he's saving money to see (He lost his job recently).

Frankly I found it really annoying and after the hang out blocked him on all social media. I did send him a final text saying it was because I was still hurt and needed space. And wished him the best. Which wasn’t entirely true."

78	455	adjudicated	NAH	"I (20F) and my fiancé (24M) have been attending a church for a while. On a particular Sunday a new guy came. We can call him B (30M) we got to know him and he was a pretty cool guy. The more we hung out with him, the more we got to know his situation and why he moved.
Fast forward, my fiancé and him became good friends he told us that his fiancé and her son (23F and 8M) were moving here. B said we would like her and can become good friends. Our first interaction after meeting her was awkward. This could be because she just relocated and didn’t know us. A few weeks back I had gifted B a hat and B’s fiancé a purse for when she arrived. I would like to add that since I’ve met B’s fiancé I had a feeling in my gut. The type of feeling where you know to have your guard up. 
We then had a beach day. Naturally upon seeing us B came to hang out with us. B’s fiancé was with him as well. The gifts were brought up and B’s fiancé never said thank you. This might just be me but if I’m gifting someone expensive gifts I would expect a thank you. I shrugged it off as nothing and B’s fiancé never talked to me. I didn’t want to force a convo so I kept my distance. A few weeks later my fiancé, B, B’s fiancé and I went out and something I noticed was that when I would talk to B his fiancé would get right in between the both of us. I didn’t pay much attention to this until my fiancé pointed it out. I thought maybe she was insecure but I have my fiancé who I’ve been with for over 3 years. I didn’t see how I might be a threat.
We started seeing them less. We understand that he has a family here. Recently my parents invited them over. I was carrying a Louis Vuitton bag when B’s fiancé says “Let me see your bag, I remember seeing something where if the stitching isn’t yellow it’s not real” I hand her my bag and of course the stitching is yellow. For reference I have an LV nano speedy. That comment seemed unnecessary. Later that night we went bowling and my fiancé was paying for everyone including her kid. I heard her say to B, “I want a pizza but I don’t want to share with everyone” I turned around a let her know that my fiancé was paying for the package pizza, drinks, shoes, and 2 hours of bowling. We came back to my house after. I then notice that she was looking up my bags price. B then said “Dang your bag is expensive” Maybe this was just an innocent comment but I didn’t appreciate the fact that they were looking up how much my things cost. B has always made comments saying how blessed we are to be able to afford nice things or live comfortably.

The next Sunday I said hi to them and didn’t speak to them after that. Since then I spoke with my fiancé and let him know that they have been making me uncomfortable. I let him know that he can hang out with B. However I will not be around. I simply don’t want to be near B or B’s fiancé.She has continued to give me a certain feeling in my gut and I just don’t like it."

I’m not a big party person, I used to be when I was 14-16 but now i kinda don’t like drinking and, with me being very introverted, I kanda just sit and watch as I don’t feel comfortable dancing or socializing when i’m not drunk.

My gf loves to dance and drink, she loves to talk to new people and the party atmosphere or “vibe” in general.

Just now, she called me and asked me if I really wanted to go, to which i asked why I wouldn’t when I’ve told her all week and every time we go to parties that even if it isn’t my ideal environment I still like to accompany her to these kind of events.

I asked her if she didn’t want me to go and she said “not if you’re gonna be like how you are at every other party”.

I started asking more questions and all of a sudden she said “I don’t want you to go if you’re honna be a bore and throw my vibes off” (I know it sounds kinda stupid but we had this covo in spanish and I think it translates quite well.).

Now, looking back at it, I realize I victimized myself. I used a “hurt” tone of voice, And you can imagine the rest, this ties to the next paragraph.

Of course I haven’t told her that I only wanna go because I don’t fully trust in her, as we have had problems about her boundaries with people who very obviously want to hook up with her.

(E.g: Speaking to her ex who still clearly loves her, letting other men make comments like “oh you’re so pretty” and laughing it off. Me having to tell her that she should shut them down instead of playing dumb)

I get that I shouldn’t have to worry about stuff like this because a woman who truly loves me would never make me feel insecure, I also know that no matter how much i could possibly control or keep tabs on her, if she want to cheat she’ll find a way to do it.

On her side, (this is all MY OPINION, not hers) I do somewhat understand her feelings of wanting me to be more social and dance and all of that, but she knows that because i’m so introverted the only way for me to achieve that is through alcohol. 

I believe she just wants me to have as good a time as her, but she doesn’t know how to express it. 

AITA for not wanting her to be in a “risky” situation in which any man can approach her while I’m not there?

I know I’m insecure and probably sound like a child  but please try to look at it from both our PoV’s. 
 
Thanks in advance.

Edit: So, i’ve seen people not truly understanding my position on infidelity and respect to a relationship (because I was most definetely too vague) so here it goes:

I understand that shutting men down is not really a safe practice due to men being generally aggresive and/or jerks to girls that reject them, specially at parties where there is alcohol involved. I did not mean the specific context of a party.

Here are some examples: 

She is currently talking frequently to 3 dudes that have a crush / like / want to be her bf:

1.- Transfer student at uni, he started off as a normal dude yet by the third day of my gf befriending him he started with a barrage of compliments, confessions of love and flirting. She did not put a stop to it. (This was mostly done through IG).

2.- her ex. He treated her like absolute shit, typa dude that asked her for nudes and then when she didn’t send any (which to my knowledge she never did), he would try to manipulate her into feeling bad and sending them. He (IMO, SA) tried to hook up with her girl best friend, being very oppresive and persistent even after she said no multiple times. He told her he would commit toaster bath (community rules). She has told me she would block him multiple times yet after 3 days he is unblocked. 

3.- Random dude that hits on her via replying to IG stories, snapchat and through her friends. She just responds to her normally. 

There was a situation where she was responding to snaps and I had my hand wrapped around her shoulder. She noticed my hand and told me I “ruined the picture” then took another one and i snuck my hand in again, resulting in her getting mad at me. 

We have talked through and fixed 1 and 3 yet I still cannot trust her due to her fixation on her ex. 

Everytime a woman has come close to me with intention of flirting or whatever (2 or 3 times, weve been dating 9 months now) I have immediately shut them down either by staring at my phone’s wallpaper (my gf), by straight up just ignoring them and by being extremely cold and uninterested in them. Not one of them still talks to me. 

I believe if I’m giving that treatment, I should recieve it too.

Many of you will tell me to break up, yet I cannot bring myself to do it. I believe we can get through all of this and thus I have hung on and will continue to hang on until I can completely trust her (unless of course she does something 
unforgivable [unlikely]). 

I knew e from the start that I was always going to have people after her as she is very beautiful, but i didn’t expect to have to tell her how to give respect to our relationship. 

We are not highschoolers, but we are only 2nd semester at uni, so you’re not comoletely wrong.

I do not feel it as “disrespect” towards me, i’m sorry if I suggested that, but I do believe she does not give our relationship the respect it deserves, although it has gotten a lot better.

262	368	adjudicated	NAH	"This is really trivial, but I'm really uncomfortable with it. So, I (17M) just moved to another country a few months ago and entered a new school there. That's how I met someone (16M) who is also from my community. As we came from a non-English speaking country, we were placed in ESL classes. As time goes by, my teacher looked upon my English skill and decided to move my class to more advanced class. My friend, seeing that I moved on, also wanted to move in so he has the same class with me.

When I was in the ESL class, everything goes fine with me and him But when he moved to the same class with me later, I feel a bit more uncomfortable. Firstly, he sat in someone's else chair so he can sit near me. This was fault because I didn't warn him about how he sat in someone's else chair. It's too late anyways to ask him to move chair, and this results in that someone move to another chair. Secondly, he always put his foot in my chair's stretcher, and that makes me a lot uncomfortable. I don't have the gut to ask him to not do that, but I always give reaction as if I'm uncomfortable to realize him that I'm not okay with it. He sometimes is aware of it, but still doit anyways. Thirdly, he always asks for me for my answer in the class. This is probably the problem, while he is able to survive in the class, he still struggles with his English. I think he will do better if he still in ESL class.

This might be too trivial, but I think this uncomfortability exists because I just don't fit in with my friend and his group. Sometimes I feel to be hypocritical as I leave him as a friend, but it seems that he doesn't even care when I approach him as a friend. So, AITA for wanting to stay away from him in the class?"
323	460	adjudicated	TTA	"I (38 M) and my wife (35 F) met online years ago and we have a wonderful family together. We live in Canada where I'm from, and she is from the Philippines.

My family has always been pretty accepting of our relationship, but her family took some time to get used to the idea. Her Dad is chill and her sister and I get along great, but her Mother is very difficult. By difficult I dont just mean gets upset sometimes, I mean awful Hollywood Mother In Law levels of mean.

On this occasion her parents offered to buy my soon to be wife (and by proxy myself) a new car. Now I'd never owned a car at this point and we were just starting out, so we had no money to put into a vehicle. My wife was thrilled about the idea, but I was a little more reserved.

I had never been given such an extravagant gift. We talked on facetime to them overseas and I stayed mostly quiet since it was, in my mind, between my wife and her parents, but they really wanted me involved. I loved the idea, but had doubts.

My wife had told me about how badly her mother's temper was. What if we signed for a car and they refused to send the money? Like I said we had nothing saved, she was new to the country and I had a mediocre job.

Finally, I told them ""I found some great used cars"" But they had decided it needed to be brand new. I finally asked them ""Are you sure? Cars are very expensive and while I appreciate the offer I just want to make sure it's ok.""

When I tell you this question set my mother in law off I am not exaggerating. She literally did not talk to is for months!

My wife told me this was what she expected, and while they did actually want to get her a car, they craved the drama.

Months later they finally started talking to us again. One of the first things mentioned was cars. They were still overseas but thought it prudent to get one as they'd be visiting soon.
I decided the only sensible thing to do was go with the flow. I knew I had no money for a car and if they really wanted this for their daughter who was I to get in the way... until the day came to pay.

My wife had just started working and we had maybe $3000 in savings that we were putting aside for a home downpayment in the next few years. My in laws asked the final price of the car and I had said it was $43000. They agreed the should get it and they would wire the money to their daughter.

I put down  $500 (doable even for me at the time) and they sent us a wire... for 40000. They expected that I could handle the other $2500 even though we had explained we had nothing saved. After paying for documents to get her here I was tapped out. My wife talked to them and they said we could handle it and that they'd bring the remainder when they visited next time to which I said ok... WRONG ANSWER!

Again a few months of no talking to us they arrived. ""what a nice car we got you"" started right away. I was happy to have a vehicle but now being broke, shot down and unsure of how I'd ever measure up i wondered... AITA?"

So when my sister announced she was getting married, I asked my closest friend Jake if he wanted to go with me since we both had never been to a wedding before. He said yes and we were (but mostly I) counting down the days, because I knew my sister even considering marriage was very important since we came from separate moms. 

I had reiterated multiple times the date of my sister’s wedding to my friend to make sure he had something to wear and what time I would pick him up. He has a spam account on instagram he likes to shitpost on, and 2 days before the wedding he posted (direct quote)“So basically, both of my eyes are super swollen and kind of sticky. I think it might be because I had like three shrimp yesterday and so I woke up with an allergic reaction which I already knew I was allergic to shrimp but I didn't know that it would do this and usually just makes my throat close, but I just wanted to be sure so I ate some more shrimp and now my eyes wont go back to normal.” I read this a bit shocked? And honestly irritated, bc this situation sounded easily avoidable. And responded in the comments “take some Benadryl, wtf” 

We didn’t talk about it until the day of the wedding, where he apologized if his eyes looked a bit weird and reiterated he ate shrimp knowing it would cause an allergic reaction but this was not the one he was expecting. I asked him why he would do that days before my sister’s wedding, especially if he predicted it to close his throat. He said the last time he had a reaction it only lasted for an hour and then he took Benadryl but yeah he looks “a little silly” lol. He asked if I was mad and I said honestly it made me a bit peeved. I was already on edge because of family issues that morning, so maybe that heightened this situation in my mind but I told him it was weird he was putting himself in harms way before my sisters wedding. He responded that he “didn’t do it to spite me.” (???) And “it’s not like I’d have to go to the hospital”. 

I could see where maybe I was making a big deal out of nothing? I’ve never had mild allergic reactions where I just pop a pill and deal with it, so I don’t know. But it’s also like, really? Before my sisters wedding? What would’ve happen if your throat closed and Benadryl wasn’t enough? It’s just worrying to think about, but it’s not my body and I don’t know what’s best for him I guess. I talked to 2 different friends about it and asked if it was a bit weird and they both agreed, but I could be in an echo chamber. So Reddit, what do you think?"
79	465	adjudicated	TTA	"Hello, my relationship with my girlfriend of 4 months ended a few weeks back, mainly due to quite a few disagreements that we couldn't agree on, so decided it was best to end it. There was one particular argument we would go back and forth on which I'm struggling to come to grips with and I wanted some second opinions. I feel my feelings in this situation were warranted, I'm very open to constructive criticism and would like some advice if I was in the wrong:

So it was a Wednesday night where I had two very bad sleeps the two nights prior, so I was quite tired on the Wednesday. We hung out together on the Tuesday night and she slept over mine, and then we spent Wednesday morning together before she went home. I was laying in bed Wednesday night and we were just chit chat texting, when she asked if I could come over. As much as I would have liked to, I told her I'm about to go to sleep as I was really tired since I didn't sleep well the past 2 days (I also had work the next day). She got upset that I didn't come over and in her mind she thought i didn't want to see her, which wasn't the case at all, which I explained to her, and then I told her I was just exhausted from the lack of sleep and needed a good sleep before work the next day. I then got a bit upset as I felt she was questioning how much I liked her and my commitment to seeing her, while I felt she wasn't taking in account my feelings and being tired. Her argument was that I'm a guy and I just need 4 clothing items, all I had to do was pack it in my bag and drive to hers, and that if I liked her that much it wouldn't be a problem.

Was I in the wrong here? From her perspective, she felt that I wasn't showing her how much I liked and wanted her. I'm someone who is very open with understanding other peoples emotions and feelings, but I felt in this situation my feelings were not being accounted for. We have argued about this quite a few times, and when I broke up with her and I brought it up again, she said ""what do you want me to just say, okay have a good sleep?!?!""

EDIT: What made this even more confusing for me was a contradicting situation that occurred probably 3 weeks after this. One night I visited her late at night around 10:30pm and surprised her with flowers, then we were just hanging out in her room when I said I could sleep over tonight and then go to my grandpas house when I wake up in the morning (had arranged to go visit him and mow their grass), but to this she said no because she wants to get a good sleep herself before a birthday party she had in the morning and wanted time to get ready etc. I understood her, and left her house shortly after so she can sleep."
39	63	adjudicated	NAH	"theres a lot of context here😅.

back when I (f18) was in the 4-5th grade I had made a joke trying to convince my friends that i was an undercover spy and that my real name was Alex. i was about 10 at the time so ofc it was a stupid joke mad by a little kid. my friends had played along with it (knowing it was a joke) and from that moment forward they called me Alex as an inside joke. the joke went around the class and not too long after everyone had started to call me that name. middle school came along and i ended up going to the same school with some of my friends and classmates so the name stuck around. it came to the point where it was barely even a joke anymore and they just called me Alex as a nickname/ second name. 

fast forward to now, im currently a senior in hs and still friends with a couple of ppl from the same friend group from when i was 10. i still use Alex as not only my name but a name i introduced myself as (unless the person im talking to requires to know my legal name). every friend that i have is either from 5 grade or from my theater program (outside of school). the program in question is completely free and is something i dont have to pay for out of pocket, the only thing they ask for is DOB, name, any alias, and parental contact info. 

my friends from theater know me solely by Alex, its what i introduced myself as, and its what im used to as ive been called it for the past 8 years. i was hanging out with them after a class we had, eating, and i was telling them a story about what happened with my mom. i had repeated what my mom had said (a sentence that included my legal name) and off they were confused. i casually told them about the whole situation and one of my friends stated that it felt like i lied to her. another said that he was just surprised. i told this to some of my other buddies and even tho they understood me using the name they also think that i shouldve told them about it being an alias when we first met.

AITAH?"
451	54	adjudicated	TTA	"I (18F) and my dad (50M) have had a rough relationship for about a year and a half now, almost two.

When I was young, I was a huge dad’s girl and I never really developed a close relationship with my mom, so you can already assume that he was literally the one person I’ve trusted my whole life.

A little short story that will be beneficial to the story, being the naive girl I was back then, I had my first ever boyfriend at 14. He was my age as well and we were friends for quite awhile before he asked me out. Long story short, my aunt found out and snitched on me! My dad confronted me about it and said I was too young and of course I agreed. The night of the confrontation, I broke up with that ex boyfriend because I valued my dad and I’s relationship. The ex didnt take it well so I didnt feel too bad about it after, he expected a lot from me that I just couldn’t give and didn’t realize how important my dad and i’s relationship was to me. A few minutes after, I told my dad that it was over between him and I and he went from ignoring me and giving me the cold shoulder, to acting like it never happened!

Fast forward to a year ago, my boyfriend of 1 year ( I was 17 and he was 18 at this time ) was flying to me and needed help with finding a place. Just a note, my dad was aware that we’ve been dating and initially, he didn’t take it too well, but I really liked this guy, so I didn’t end things so quickly like before. It took him 6 months of non-stop asking to say Yes and I was happier than ever. 

During his stay, it was the worst possible experience between my dad and I. He would never want to talk to my bf when I really wanted him to so that he can get to know him and realize how much of a keeper he was. Many things happened, my dad called me a whore ( in his exact words: “what are you, a whore? ) after accidentally falling asleep beside my bf one night. He always made sure I knew he was dissapointed in me, but gave me the cold shoulder when I asked what’s wrong. My bf bought my dad a coffee maker knowing he was a coffee addict, but still no progress. Just a “thanks” and shut us both out. I feel bad because I know my bf is trying and he’s achieving nothing.

I’m just drained and tired of apologizing when I get nothing in return. It’s like my apologies are just running off a cliff. I’ve stopped apologizing for a few months now and let time heal us, but I don’t think I ever see my relationship with my dad going back to the way it was.

I understand that I wasn’t 18 yet and he was just new to the whole me dating somebody, but I think the insults and telling everybody our business from HIS pov were too far. Nobody ever asks me what happened because i’ve been painted as the bad guy and him, the innocent dad who has a bratty daughter. It affects me a lot, knowing I lost one of my biggest trust and support factors. 

He uses the excuse that he’s scared that my bf will cheat on me ( even after 2 years of dating… ). 

Should I try apologizing again?"
46	0	adjudicated	TTA	my boyfriend and I live with my parents. I pay them rent and pay for the wifi. I also am buying (with my boyfriend) our own food so my parents don’t have the burden of feeding us. The other day my parents got upset with me for cooking my own food saying I should cook for everyone in the house and when my boyfriend and I go out to eat, should buy everyone else food too (the other people in the house are my parents and my little sister). Keep in mind, I make sure not to cook when they are so I’m not in their space. I also make sure to clean up all the dishes I use and the kitchen when I am finished cooking. Another thing to note is that we used to not buy our own food, but my mother (whom I love to death but has zero cooking skills) and her cooking just didn’t give us enough calories or nutrition for our diets and lifestyle, so we started buying our own food. My boyfriend and I’s diet is high protein and my parents have said that they don’t like that type of food or meals.I don’t have the budget to a) buy more food to serve three more people and b) buy different food that fits there taste. Don’t get me wrong, I try to help my parents out where I can but I feel like their anger was uncalled for. Is this not the right stance?  Should I be making two different meals every night for my family?
238	150	adjudicated	ESH	"Hi Reddit, 
Am I (F30) the AH for leaving my work pens out in the kitchen? 
I am a paramedic and come across many gross, unsavoury things throughout my work hours. I of course wear gloves when touching poo, wee, blood and other bodily fluids, and do not remove them while using pens to write during these cases. 

After my most recent shift, I put a number of these pens with my trauma shears & pupil torch onto the kitchen cabinet where we keep other random junk. 

Today, my sister (F26), grabbed my most used pen unknowingly and used it to write in our calendar. I then saw her with the end of this pen in her mouth (she has a habit of doing this). 
I warned her that I’d used this pen this shift, while wearing gloves that definitely had urine and other bodily fluids on them. 
She was immediately disgusted and washed her mouth, and says it was my fault for leaving these pens out. 

AITA or is she responsible to not put random pens in her mouth?

EDIT - It’s a big kitchen, and I didn’t put them where we make food. It’s also the first time I’ve left them on the bench! 

EDIT #2 - Thanks guys. If you couldn’t tell by the heavily weighted title, I am the younger sister in this scenario. We had a great laugh about this before deciding to put it up for Reddit’s judgement. Thanks to everyone who were kind in their feedback, and for those who weren’t… touch some grass. 
I was later told that really the pen was clean and she was just being hyperbolic, but it was an interesting debate nonetheless. 
From now on all work related tools will stay far away from common areas, and I will try to stop putting random objects in my mouth. 

For those that said ESH - Agreed!! "

She forgets where she is, can not recognise she is home, forgets that she has eaten, taken her pills, gone to the toilet etc. Basically she can not be left alone.

Me(26f) and my mother(53) are currently taking care of her 24/7. We are getting her pills she has to take daily, giving them to her, cooking for her, feeding her, basically everything. 

Grandma can not sleep at night and roams around the apartment pushing stuff over, spilling drinks etc. Every time I hear her get up, I jump out of bed to help out. The whole situation causes me a lot of anxiety, but my mother makes it even worse.

My mother has some severe anger issues which have caused me a lot of trauma in my childhood. Now she can not hold in her anger with my grandma when she forgets something or gets up at night and is constantly yelling at her. 

Sometimes I am sleeping in my room with the door closed and I get woken up by the yelling and I get frozen, I can not get up and I just curl up in bed trying to silence the yelling. I have the fear that they will hurt each other and I won’t be able to do anything because of my trauma response and anxiety.

I am starting a new job as well so I won’t be able to stay home 24/7 and tend to my grandma’s needs as much as I can now. This is where I might be the a-hole. I feel selfish for wanting to leave this situation and get an apartment on my own for my mental health and ability to function properly without that much stress and anxiety. I will still go check up on her and help out daily, but won’t be able to do it as much as I do now.

So WIBTA for leaving?"
352	4	adjudicated	YTA	"I'm a little on the fence about this although I do think I'm ultimately justified in my decision. I (18f) recently picked up a seasonal side job at a haunted house. I had worked at haunts as a teenager and figured it was a great way to make some extra money.
However one thing that was fishy off that bat with this haunted house is that they don't use time cards. The one I worked at when I was a teen used timecards to keep track of employee hours. I was told our first paycheck would be October 8th, I figured no biggie, weird we wouldn't get paid for our first 2 weeks in September but I chalked it up to needing time to put in the pay information. However once the 8th rolled around I checked my bank account and the direct deposit hadn't come through. I was confused and emailed my manager and was told there was a paper check for me. I got handed a check with the wrong last name. We noticed quickly and she went digging for more checks and could not find mine. She proceeded to tell me that if some other guy didn't have it then it would have to be rolled onto my next paycheck, October 23rd. I was so upset that night I actually broke down in the parking lot. I lost my job in September and had now gone officially weeks without receiving a paycheck at all. 
I emailed my boss letting him know the severity of my situation and that I needed a check cut. I did not receive a response. I figured there was nothing I could do and decided to wait until the 23rd. The 23rd rolls around and I'm awaiting the multiple weeks worth of pay. An hourly amount of which I am not certain because I was told I would be told but then told I needed to ask but truthfully I will admit I failed to ask what the hourly was because online it said up to 18 and hour, and they said the pay was based on your availability. I put my availability for the whole season so I figured my hourly would at the very least be maybe 14 and hour. I checked my direct deposit and saw that nothing had come through, I was pissed off but worked the next day and texted my boss about it. 
At the end of my shift that night he told me he had a check for me. I got the check and saw I had made a measly $160. I was also confused as the year to date said something around 250 so I was wondering where the first check had gone. I found out it had bounced apparently and I finally got it, but what I had discovered after almost 2 months of work is that I was getting paid an estimated amount of 12 dollars an hour, plus I was only getting paid for the haunted house's hours, not the amount of time I had to be there which was 2 hours before opening and sometimes up to an hour after close. It feels entirely unworth it for me to wait around not getting paid while getting my makeup done and getting into costume.
Now here's where I might be the asshole. I really do enjoy the work I do here, we have a tight knit cast of all loveable friendly people.I have always had a strong stance on giving jobs notices because I understand what it's like having to cover for people who don't communicate. I don't want the house to lack the cast it might need to so the show,  I failed to mention halfway through the season my mom started working there aswell, If I quit she wants to quit aswell. She is an uber driver in her free time so time is money. I'm taking away 2 cast members because I'm not happy with the pay I never bothered to ask about. AITA?"

277	395	adjudicated	TTA	"So I have this friend we’ll call Kai. Kai and I have been besties for many years now, and a few months ago he came to me saying he was desperate to move out of his current place, and that he couldn’t afford to move out without roommates.

Since he’s been my best friend for so long and has done so much for me, I agreed to move in with him wherever he decided to go, but only if I could pay what I’m paying in rent now, which is $700. He was hesitant, and we agreed I’d pay that or at most a little more, like $900 max.

So now I’ve moved in. Not only did I go though a lot of hassle trying to move my stuff in, but I also had to quit my job because it was too far away to commute to now. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t very high paying either, and I’m currently in the process of getting a new one.

However, AFTER I quit my job and moved all my stuff in, my friend tells me my rent is $1000. Now, $900 was already stretching my budget pretty thin, but $1000? Like all of my money would be going towards rent now. I paid this months rent with my savings, and tried to just chalk it up to a bad coincidence, after all this was my friend and I did say I was willing to help him.

Now, here’s where I might be the asshole. This apartment is a 4 bed, and he’s charging the other tenants 1200 and 1300 respectively, meaning out of the 4000 rent, the rest of us except him pay $3500 of that, making his rent $500. Now, he has a good paying job, and he makes a good chunk of money, not enough to rent the place alone of course, but enough where I called him out on not paying the same amount as the rest of us, especially when he made it sound like he desperately needed help here. I said he was being really unfair, especially since he knows I’m not really well off.

He said nothing was stopping me from getting my own 4 bed and doing the same thing, and that if he lowered my rent he’d basically be giving me free money. He said he doesn’t remember telling me my rent would be THAT low and that I should be happy my rent is already lower than the other peoples. I yelled at him saying that he was being unethical here, but now we haven’t spoken since. he’s a really good friend every other time, and I feel bad that I made him feel bad about this. so what does the internet think?

When I asked one of the girls who was there why they chose to hang out on the only day I wasn’t free she said “well you had better plans anyway” which, in fairness, is true but I still feel betrayed as they chose to hang out on the only day I wasn’t free, and nobody even got back to me to say they’d changed the plans to Thursday. So, AITA for feeling upset about this?
317	107	adjudicated	TTA	"I (16 F), was in French class, during which another French teacher came to the door and started speaking to my teacher (Mr Waters). It was work time for us, so everyone was talking in their own little groups, but as their conversations slowly died out, mine kept going. 

As the other teacher was having a conversation with Mr Waters (who btw was sitting on the opposite ends of the room) about an excursion the class was going on, when he suddenly stopped talking and turned to me. 

He began telling me off for speaking whilst he was speaking, and asked me to repeat what the other teacher had said. Since I was only whispering, I was able to do so, and was confused as the conversation was about a change in plans for the day, so ofc I had assumed it was a conversation just for the teachers. Nonetheless, after I repeated it, he explained how me talking made it hard for him to hear the other teacher in their conversation. To this day, I still don't know why the other teacher stayed behind the door instead of just walking in. 

He then explained that I was seeking attention, and he knows that I like talking because I'm an attention seeker. I was incredulous at that, since I never would have thought he would say that, so I sort of chuckled nervously, not in a malicious way, but in a 'huh?' kind of way. 

""Is something funny?"" he asked me. ""is being disrespectful and rude funny to you?"" and I replied with a plethora of Nos. He as talking extremely loudly, and I was really embarrassed and a little scared.

He was so loud that after the class, the kids from the room next door came and asked me if I was okay. I guess I was talking while he was, but I just assumed they were having their own conversation, and people around me was talking too. 

AITA? "
304	136	adjudicated	NAH	"**Background:**
  
I was raised by my aunt and her family in a third-world country. My father was absent, and my mother was often unreliable, only stepping in to support me during my last two years of college. From childhood until now, I've lived with my aunt's family. They provided for me, from food and shelter to education, covering my schooling from primary school up to my first two years of college.
  

  
**Aunt's Financial Situation:**
  
In the past, my aunt's family was comfortably above middle class. My uncle worked overseas and earned well. However, due to my aunt's poor financial decisions, they now have no savings. She often lent money to unreliable people and made questionable bank transactions. Today, they barely make ends meet. My uncle, now in his 50s, earns less since he works locally. Their son, 27, doesn't work and spends his days playing video games. Their daughter has special needs and cannot work.
  

  
**My Financial Approach:**
  
Aware of my aunt's financial mismanagement, I've always been cautious with money. I began working in college as an ESL tutor and even back in high school I would save diligently because I wanted to build my own computer. Over the years, I've lent significant amounts from my savings to my aunt, often knowing I wouldn't get it back. For instance, during the pandemic, I helped cover expenses after her son's drunk driving accident paralyzed their finances since all of the money she receives from her husband went into paying off the accident. While the money I've lent doesn't equate to what she has spent on me, I've consistently supported them when I could before.
  

  
**Current Situation:**
  
Recently, I've resorted to not give her anymore money. My aunt's financial troubles are largely due to her own decisions, like recently getting scammed online and selling her car to send money to a fraudster. Additionally, she doesn't address her son's lack of ambition and being a bum. While I occasionally buy groceries for them, I've refrained from giving more money. 
  

  
Most of their finances is through her husband who lives onsite where he works but they don't have a good relationship anymore. My other aunt says he has another family but that's their problem now.
  

  
My mother, with whom I now have a better relationship lately, tells me not to feel guilty, mentioning she once paid for a land title for my aunt. Still, I feel guilty for not contributing more. I aim to move out soon, but I'm not financially ready. Occasionally, when my aunt asks for money, I would decline here and there but sometimes, especially if its a small sum, I'd lend her some. However, there have been times where she would tell me I'm greedy or she would give off that impression but she has directly told me off yet for not having gratitude any paying her back for what she has given raising me.
  

  
So Am I the Asshole here for not her giving any money?"
268	407	adjudicated	TTA	I, 33 female and male, 30 recently moved out of state. He took a job that will require travel and is also in grad school online. Before he took this job, he knew it would require travel and he would have to work that in with school, etc.  I have a job that starts in a week. A few days after we arrived in our new state, my boyfriend had a 10 work trip with his new boss to Florida. Unfortunately, our moving truck would arrive while he was away. It was never discussed how the unpacking would go. Everything went pretty smooth with the delivery of our stuff. We had about 115 boxes between the both of us. I started unpacking and organizing the boxes right away. I got all the furniture put where it belongs. The kitchen, bathrooms, living room and closets are done. I went through my boxes and stored whatever I didn’t need away. He has about 15-20 boxes of his stuff like childhood things, his desk/work and miscellaneous items that I told him I wasn’t sure what he’d want to do with it so he would need to go through those. Otherwise, I unpacked and put away everything else. He comes back today and last night after I told him that he had boxes to go through because I didn’t know what he wanted to do with those things, he blew up on me. Told me I was selfish for not figuring out his stuff and he’s too busy with work and grad school to unpack so his stuff will just have to remain in the boxes. I apologized for asking for any help, I said 115 boxes is a lot for one person to unpack. When I told him what I had finished, he told me that should have taken one day. I told him I am not you so things might take me longer. He guilt tripped me for spending a couple hours with my cousin that’s nearby saying I should have told her no cause I didn’t have the time, when I haven’t really left our place in 4 days. AITA?
69	391	adjudicated	TTA	"So my friend and roommate asked me if l'd go to a concert with her and I agreed to. We'd been wanting to see this artist for a while now. So a month before the concert she invited a mutual coworker to the concert as well. I didn't mind at all.

 So here's where things got weird. Everyday she brings up our coworker to me at the strangest times. She'll interrupt our conversations or a movie I'm watching to bring her up. I just ignored it. So about three weeks before the concert she tells me that she and the coworker have picked out a section and tells me which seat to buy. This already upset me because why was I not included in this process? But I ignored it not wanting to be petty and bought the ticket. Now we're at the concert. She and the coworker are talking the entire time while she probably spoke to me three times and each time the coworker interrupted and she would just start talking to her instead.
At the end of the show we get up to leave everyone is directing me to my right. As I'm waiting for it to clear I hear the girl next to me say ""your friends really just left you."" So I look to my right and sure enough they're going the opposite way and no one even tried to tell me. Anyway I get out of the arena and spot them I think they'll have the decency to wait somewhere for me or at least look around...no they continued to walk and never looked around or anything to signal they were looking for me. I stop for a few minutes still thinking they'll stop they don't.
So I decide to just walk to the car it's when I'm literally half way to the car so about 5 minutes later when she texts me asking where I'm at.Then says they're in a bathroom there are about 10 bathrooms in this arena and besides why wasn't I told earlier that that's where they were headed? I tell her I'm at the car and now she's saying they're lost and can't find the car. I tell her I don't know how to give the directions because I'm not sure wher she's exactly at but that it was near the porta potties had passed earlier. She then gets frustrated and to demands me to send my location rudely instead of asking.

I'm standing by her car in 20 degree weather with men cat calling, people running past me, and cars speeding through to leave for almost 30 minutes when they finally appear. They don't apologize or even ask if I'm okay they just laugh and hop into the car. The entire car ride I'm silent and just staring off in the distance while she begins to drive manically at the direction of the coworker. After witnessing a terrible crash she pulls over and lets the coworker drive her car (a car she refuses to let her sister drive and has never let me either when we've gone out of town claiming it's cause we're not on her insurance) she had just told me the girl can't drive and it's safe to say that she can't.

Now it's two days later and she still hasn't acknowled' what happened instead she's just ignoring me so I'm doing the same. I just feel my safety was put at risk twice that night. Am I being petty?"

465	252	adjudicated	NAH	"(i’m sorry about the mistakes, english is my seccond language) 

last weekend we had a very special entrance exam, and a lot of people took it (like my friends, my boyfriend and me)
i have taken this exam since 2021 as a trainer, so when i finish high school, i can take it very calmly and with a lot of knowledge. 

my boyfriend took it for the first time this year (we’ll finish high school next year) and he’s extremely nervous and he’s asking me a lot of questions and tips about the test. i wouldn’t stress about it because i love helping him, but he took it to far. 

i told him to rest at least three days before the exam to clear his mind, but the day before he was asking me to teach him essay tips and on the day of the exam he asked me about repertoires and pictures of my past essays. 

i hate stressing about tests days before, i always study one or two weeks before exams, and while he kept asking me about everything, i got stressed and afraid about it getting in my way. tks God it didn’t because i was chilling as much as i could and answering him very coldly. 

i felt bad because he was really nervous but he was starting to disturb me and i didn’t want this. if i helped him the way he wanted me to, i would ruin my own exam. so AITA?"

But recently my partner has been sleeping over with their friend who I didn't particularly like being around (never mention it because I don't want them to think I want them to stop being friends because that's kinda scummy) because he admitted to being attracted to my partner in highschool (it was last year, we're in college now). They slept over again tonight and I asked yesterday where he was going to sleep and my partner said 'in my bed with me' as if that's something that went without saying.

82	477	adjudicated	TTA	"So me(37f) and my husband (39m) are in the process of opening a new business, and just signed the lease 30 days ago. The space needs lots of mostly minor construction (new flooring, some wood replaced, demo of an old walk in, etc) to open and the landlord gave us permission in writing to complete the construction ourselves as none of it requires a permit. 

I'm keeping my day job until we open to help financially, which means we only have evenings and weekends to work on the place. We are on a VERY tight timeline to finish all construction before we open, so EVERY free minute in my life involves a hammer and nails right now.

Now, next door in the same building (we share a wall) is a restaurant. They are open for breakfast su-thu till 2pm and 6am-8pm fri-sa. We signed the lease anticipating to have some issues because the owner of the restaurant  next door USED TO have a similar type of business as ours and it failed due to some of their choices in a different business they owned. (They took money for contract work and never provided the service and got called out for it and essentially got run out of town due to their shifty practices). This restraunt is the last of their 4 business that is in operation and its barely hanging on (even before we got there). 

Now the restraunt owner has come over EVERY Friday and Saturday to complain about something we are doing and stating that he is having to shut down the restaurant early. 

I have explained to him that We have tried really hard to work when he's not open (3pm to midnight) BUT to meet our deadline of loading in equipment  next week we HAVE TO work weekends. We also explained that our business is going to be loud generally speaking just due to the nature if the business (which he should know, he used to own one) and told him we hope once we open, that we will draw folks to his business since we won't be serving food. But he doesn't care and comes to pester us all the time. He even called the landlords to come talk to us, but they came over and were just amazed at how nice we were making their space look, and had no concerns. 

I'm not concerned about him really, everyone in town hates him and i dont really care if he thinks we're assholes, but one of the waiters explained to us that our noise is affecting their tips and how many hours they work and that they are struggling financially and that makes us assholes since we won't NOT work on the weekends. 


TLDR:  We have to do noisy/smelly construction on weekends on our new business to open on time, but it's affecting the restraunt next door and they are calling us assholes."
477	257	adjudicated	ESH	"I (26f) live with my boyfriend (28m). I do all our laundry because I wfh and can take 5 mins here and there to load the washer/switch to dryer/fold. My boyfriend has to leave the house to work. I don’t know if this is a him thing but he takes off his clothes SO weird. For example, one or both arms will be inside out, the shirts will be rolled and somehow they end up in knots frequently. His socks are always scrunched up too so they never actually get thoroughly cleaned. I have asked him several times to please at least make his clothes are all inside out or all right side out before he puts them in the hamper. It takes me much longer to do his clothes than mine because 1) the balled up shirts don’t end up drying as quickly as the other ones and 2) having to unwind his clothes takes a while. 

Maybe this is petty but I started folding his clothes the way they come out of the dryer. I don’t have time to stand there and figure out how to untangle his shirts. It also makes me irrationally angry when I have to do it. Like I dread folding it if I know a lot of his shirts made it into that load. I also stopped folding his socks because they are gross and still covered in dog hair. 

He noticed and is upset because now his clothes are super wrinkly. I said I didn’t care because i’m doing him a favor and that y he least he could do is make sure his shirts are “normal” when they get put into the hamper.

172	489	adjudicated	ESH	"I (37f) have been with my husband (34m) for 12 years (married 8). We have been legally separated for 6+ years after I found out about a serious drug problem. He hid it for 6 years, so when I found out about this whole secret life, I was devastated. When he kept repeating the behaviour I asked him to move out and we legally separated shortly after. 

Over the years we have remained monogamous as we work through things and rebuild trust. 
This past year I've been doing my own internal work and realize I have some attraction towards women. For context, we both grew up mormon, which is a high control, very conservative religion. There wasn't a lot of space to have your own thoughts, explore the world or yourself.
 
I have 1 friend who is lesbian. I reached out to ask them what life was like, and how things changed after coming out. I was too afraid to talk to my husband because I feared his reaction/rejection (his family is incredibly homophobic). 

Over the course of 4 days I hung out with this friend and asked a lot of questions. They ended up making a move on me. Some flirting happened, I stopped it and sent her home. The next day they came over again to work on job applications and initiated contact again. I shut it down again, but they were persistent. At different times during the encounters I did reciprocate some flirtness and cuddling (i actually dont know why bc they are 100% not my type at all, and i am not attracted to them at all). However I also kept letting them know that I didn't want to be crossing these lines and would stop everything, only for them to start initiating things again.

For reasons I don't fully understand myself, I let them hang out and eventually the flirting progressed to them putting their hands down my pants (i did not reciprocate). I stopped them, sent them home and eventually told them I want no contact with them.
I told my husband immediately and have been very transparent on everything. To my surprise, he doesn't even care that I'm gay/bi/whatever.
He is hurt about the betrayal. Which, given my history with him, I 100% understand. I've encouraged him to ask as many questions as he feels necessary, have offered him my phone, and am signing him up for health insurance so he can go to therapy for more support. 
He wants to talk this out with a friend who also grew up mormon. Initially I was okay with it bc I know he needed a support. But he plans to tell his friend about my sexuality and I'm not okay with this. I feel that while I made a huge mistake and he has the right to seek support about me cheating, that I have the right to control who I come out to and when.He doesn't think coming out or being outed is that big of a deal anymore.
 
My husband thinks I am a hypocrit because I did tell friends about his drug issues, though it was a couple of years into it and it was for safety reasons(there was a lot of gaslighting involved).

90	381	adjudicated	TTA	"I (25M) will be getting married to my amazing fiancée Dove (25F) in March. Dove always knew she wanted a spotlighted dance with both her parents and not just the typical father-daughter dance. When she told me this I decided to ask my sisters (24F, 23F) if they would do a spotlight dance with me after Dove and her family. They jumped at the chance and we started to practice. We know what song we'll be dancing to and we've pretty much got our routine down.

My stepmother asked me several weeks ago if I was going to ask her to do a mother-son dance at the wedding. She made it clear she had expected to be asked before that point and was asking herself because she was tired of waiting. I told her I was not asking her. She asked if I was really going to sit there and watch Dove dance with her parents and refuse to do one because my mom died 14 years ago. I told my stepmother that I was not going to just sit there because my sisters and I were doing one together. She stormed off after that.

A couple of weeks later my father and stepmother asked me why I said I was dancing with my sisters when my stepsister (21F) and half sisters (13F, 9F) had never been asked. I told them I asked my two full sisters and the three of us were doing it together and my step and half siblings (I have a stepbrother and two half brothers too) were not included in that. They asked me how that was supposed to make them feel. My stepmother told me that her kids had always felt like they could not get close to my sisters and me because we had an impenetrable barrier between us and any other siblings who would have come into our lives. She said it was horrible that we lost our mom but our family grew and instead of coming together and leaning on having a bigger family, we kept it to just us and we have never viewed her kids as siblings in any real way. She said she has also tried her best to be a good bonus mother and we have never viewed her as anything more than the woman our father is married to.

My father said he felt like he failed us. I told him he had, repeatedly, and at least he was finally admitting it. I told him when you emotionally and physically abandon your three children who are on the cusp of losing their mother and continue to abandon them afterward, it is a failure to them and he should come to terms with that.

They said that was all true but be that as it may, it doesn't mean we shouldn't reach out to embrace and love the newer members of our family and the wedding dance could be a perfect way to cut step and half and just all be siblings. I told them I did not want that. They told me I was then worse than my father and my actions were more cruel.

I should say this is the most we have spoken in years. I am low contact with them usually and they are not a big part of my life.

414	190	adjudicated	NAH	"My son’s first birthday is on a Saturday despite his actual birthday being the Sunday after. My dad is throwing a fit over the party being on Saturday instead of Sunday because of a few reasons. 

1) my dad has a kid that is only 8 and he has joint custody with his ex wife. His son, my half-brother, is at his mom’s (my dads ex wife - no relation to me or my family) on the weekends but comes back to my dad’s on Sundays. He says that Hudson can’t make the party because he’s at his mom’s, but any other Saturday football game that my dad wants his son at is okay and doable to get him out of custody schedule. 

2) My dad is a season ticket holder for a football team where we live. He says that he isn’t missing a game for this when it could have been on a Sunday. 


My point of view: my husband and I HATE Sunday activities other than church. My SIL always has birthday parties for her kids on Sundays at 4pm and that puts us home so late with a baby. Most of my family is about an hour away from us and usually helps with the set up and clean up. Sundays put them home so late. 
On the point of hating Sunday activities, hosting a party is an all day activity. It starts in the morning with set up and cleaning and ends with tear down and cleaning. My family’s parties are over the top and I feel pressured to do ours that way. This one birthday will be big, but the rest will not be dictated by my family’s standards. I like to relax on Sunday afternoons before the rat race of the work week begins. 

A different view: my dad hasn’t seen my son since May (5 months ago) and only saw him at his birth and Christmas before that. He only calls when 8yo son’s Xbox messes up and my husband has to help guide them through how to fix it. Not sure why a non-present grandparent should dictate our scheduled events. 

Questions? Ask away 

Am I wrong for holding the birthday party on the day we want or should it be on Sunday due to football/grandparent?"

I became close with him fast and formed a little friend group of him, me and my friend from high school who we'll call Ella. It was all fun and games until Steve and Ella essentially turned into a situationship which kind of turned me into a third wheel. I have many other friends, but our ""group"" was very close for a few weeks.

Additionally, Steve has done/said some things to me that made me feel uncomfortable around him, like joking about hooking up with Ella in my dorm room or asking to use my dorm room as a personal space to cry/be emotional in (for context, I have a single dorm due to medical needs). Whenever me and Steve have spent time together without Ella, he either talks about hooking up with Ella or says something else to me that rubs me the wrong way. Like before he and Ella started getting closer, he would always ask if my female friends were single and ""joke"" about getting with them. He would also ask very personal and private questions to me that I found intrusive. While some of this may be because Steve and I became close friends a bit too fast, his actions make me uncomfortable and I have never acted the way he acts toward me to him or any of my friends.

He has been a good friend sometimes, but everything else he has done has outweighed the good. For the past few weeks, my gut has been telling me to distance myself.

My birthday is soon and I plan on inviting many people. However, I don't want to invite Steve as I am trying to distance myself from him right now. But I'm worried that if I don't invite him, he'll get offended and/or Ella will get offended (I do plan on inviting Ella as I have known her for a long time) Also, if I invite him he'll be the only guy at my party which might be a little awkward. I know that from his perspective I probably will be an a hole for not inviting him, but the way he has been acting is really just making me not want to invite him to my party. To be honest, I feel a little guilty about not wanting to invite him, but at the same time I've only known him for like 2 months.

Since our first child was born my MIL has had various freak outs and quits. Luckily my mom loves watching him and gladly takes the extra 2 days when this happens. My MIL will randomly cry about how we are keeping her grandson from her and my husband caves and lets her watch him again.

She recently purchased an Escalade brand new and told my husband she bought it so she could safely take our child wherever she wants. Mind you we NEVER asked her to do that. Anyways she had my FIL text me today and try to pressure us into her being able to take him all over on the 2 days she has him. One of the places was a mall an hour and 10 minutes away. We have had multiple conversations about how we don’t want him going farther then 10 minutes from her house since they are surrounded by stores, restaurants, and a park. I get worried when I’m at work about where he is and want him local. Plus it’s snowing here now and I don’t want anything to happen to him. I told them no that we had already discussed this previously. Now I’m waiting for the blowup that is surely brewing. She will call names and yell about how my parents have done nothing for my child because she opened him a trust fund. She basically threatens to close it and never help us again.

For group events I always say hi, make small talk, and will continue to do so. However, I don't want to invite to our party (at our house). WIBTA if I don't invite her?"
472	191	adjudicated	NAH	I (44f) have a younger sister (33f) who struggles with multiple mental health issues. She has been manipulative to myself and my parents for as long as I can remember. She has also been in multiple abusive relationships with addicts and needs to be rescued frequently. She has two children under two with her current partner who also has mental health issues. Her partner does not like myself or my husband bc we see through all of his bullshit. They currently live with my parents who bend over backwards for my sister out of what I feel is guilt. Her current partner finished a stint in rehab earlier this year and as result of his issues, he lost his job. When my mom told them they could not use her credit card to pay for their car insurance, he canceled the policy. A few weeks ago, I was over at my parents house and my mom shared that the cops had to be called early in the morning due to them fighting. It's not the first time, but I did notice bruises on my sister's arms which broke my heart. Fast forward to last week, my birthday. My sisters partner was at work and left my sister without a vehicle to get to therapy. She had to use my parents vehicle and purposely came home late which caused my parents to be late to my birthday dinner. (To be clear, my sister was not invited bc boundaries). She didn't even wish me a happy birthday until my mom told her something about it that evening. Two days ago, my sister blew up my phone so I reluctantly answered bc my fear was that something was wrong with one of our parents. Turns out her partner was stranded with 2 flat tires while trying to get home at 9:45pm (even though he gets off work at 4pm). She asked me to pick him up and drop him off at my parents house which is in a small town 30 minutes away. I initially said yes bc I was put on the spot, but after talking to my hubsand, I realized this was a bad idea and I didn't want to help him. He's abusive to my sister, manipulates my parents financially, and if he hadn't cancelled their insurance out of spite would have had roadside assistance. So AITA for not helping him?
362	215	adjudicated	ESH	"I36f had been married to my ex husband for many years, where my children and I suffered nothing but abuse, thievery, insults, physical harm. He was an addict, and an alcoholic. I divorced him and took off with my children, 3 years ago. He didn’t fight for the kids thankfully, and had only see them some holidays. 

Our oldest son(12) had a terminal illness. He began getting worse. On his last few weeks, I had reached out to my ex multiple times, which he only came to see him once, under the influence, n spent most the time dozing in n out. A few weeks ago, my son passed and I still cannot believe I’m typing that. I called and got no show, I spammed his phone, called his mother, his friends, no show no respond back.

We recently held his celebration of life, and I chose not to invite my ex husband. His parents and siblings were invited as they had a relationship with my son. A few days after, my ex showed up at my house crying saying I had stolen that from him, his chance to say goodbye by not Inviting him. I told him I reached out several times and he wasn’t there when my son was alive to say goodbye when he had the chance. He said that wasn’t right, that I was a bitch and I should’ve never kept him from his sons celebration of life. He was furious, I had to have my current bf escort him out. Then later I received text from a random number saying the same things and how he’d now never be able to properly grieve. Aita?"
324	65	adjudicated	TTA	"My Bf (23M) and I(19F) were on a call going over details for this weekend. After getting my costume today, he got upset that I had an outfit and he didn’t. I explained that I have been wanting this outfit regardless because I like to cosplay, and if I didn’t order it that day then I wouldn’t have anything at all (last year was a mess because he had a $200 anakin costume and I had to last minute diy a padme outfit). I explained that I have been asking for weeks what he has wanted to do because he thought all of my ideas were lame. He then suggested him being a doctor and me being his mental patient. I got a little offended at this because I had suggested doing the operation game (denied) last time I saw him, and he often mentions my mental health problems (which we both have). I told him that I didn’t like that he suggested that, and I told I’m not dressing up as an insult to myself. He then went back to how my costume and my ideas were lame and “geeky” and started to yell at me.
We’re on call, so the volume of his voice was debatable, but it was clear he was getting frustrated. I have a lot of problems with being yelled at due to childhood trauma, and he knows this, but usually I can handle it. I urgently told him to stop yelling at me and that I will not be yelled at by him. He explained he started yelling because I had cut him off 3 or 4 times within half a sentence, but I hadn’t opened my mouth. I said that maybe one of our sides were lagging because that is a frequent problem. He then told me to stop gaslighting him and calling him abusive. I was very confused at this comment so I said “I’m just setting a boundary. I shut down when I’m yelled at, especially when I don’t believe I did anything wrong.” I also explained that I never called him abusive, but he said I was insinuating it because I set a boundary. I explain how that didn’t make sense, and he followed it up with “setting a boundary means it has happened repeatedly.” I told him that was not the case and I just have childhood trauma from it. He said that we weren’t talking about the past and that has nothing to do with what we were talking about, but I said it did because that is why I told him to stop yelling. The moment it had started, I was already shaking and could barely get a sentence out. He told me then that it was my own problem and something I need to work on because he doesn’t have any issues asking someone to stop nicely. He followed this all with “is this relationship even worth it?” He then said I should apologize for telling him to stop yelling at me and to take accountability for the fact I cut him off when I don’t believe I did, and I believe if it sounded like it was a technological error which I already said could have been from both or either side, and I had apologized if it sounded like I had cut him off.  I am currently in tears because I don’t know if what I said was wrong.  I’m just very confused and not sure what to think. AITAH?"
431	91	adjudicated	YTA	Basically got two friends, both of them are real close, one is a guy and the other a girl. Me and the girl used to be involved, and she was way more emotional about me than I was her, we were casual. My guy friend was a dude I always talked about girls with, I really considered him my boy we got girls with together and stuff so I always told him everything about what me and the girl did. He always tried to urge me to do more with her, be more serious, but I wasn’t into her like she was into me so I didn’t want to, eventually I ended thing with her casually but we continued friends. I moved away for work and one night I’m talking to the girl, she tells me that this old friend and her had “did stuff” together the day prior, she also asked me not to tell the guy. I said okay cool, but like I said I considered this guy my close friend so I went to him kinda to big him up because he got her, like guy talk shit. Immediately he started saying that I was into her and that I didn’t have to pretend, that he wouldn’t deal with her again I didn’t have to worry. I was like wow bro I was the one that ended things with her, Im not into her I’m just bigging u up. He wouldn’t have it. Then the girl messaged me saying why the fuck did I tell I broke her trust and shit, really started giving it to me like swearing and stuff and calling me names because I ruined her thing. Am I the asshole?

I also am looking to get engaged so I entered the competition myself. In return I received a message from said friend saying she was upset that I entered as well. Mind you the company has 192k followers & it was a public post.. am I the asshole?
86	180	adjudicated	NAH	"I (28F) just ended a two year relationship - it's fine, it was a long time coming, and my ex officially moved out of my flat on Saturday so I actually feel relieved more than anything. I decided to book next week off of work with no specific plans or anything, just to take a break and process things. When I mentioned this on a call with my parents (60s) they suggested that I spend the week at their house instead, saying that they just want to make sure I can relax and focus on myself for a while.
  

  
I thanked them for the offer but I don't feel up to that right now. They kept politely offering and I kept politely refusing until my mum got upset and asked why - so I admitted that visiting them isn't exactly relaxing. Whenever I'm there, I'm - understandably - expected to contribute to the housework, and their house takes a LOT of housework.
  

  
They have four dogs who need three walks a day. At this time of year, when everywhere is muddy and wet, they also need washing after each walk. The dogs become solely my responsibility because my parents work from home during the week.
  

  
I also become responsible for the shopping (to be fair, my parents cover the cost) because when I'm not there, one of them has to give up their entire lunch break to do it. This also means I do the meal planning and most of the cooking. They have a lot of laundry, multiple loads a day, which I do because they can't step away from work often enough to keep on top of it and it stresses them out. They like the house hoovered, mopped and all surfaces wiped down every day. I do that every day in my own flat too (minus the mopping) but I've only got three rooms to worry about. My parents have a 5 bed.
  

  
They have a dishwasher but my mum HATES it running without a full load so I end up doing all the washing up by hand because she doesn't like the sink being full of plates and mugs and cutlery between meals either. My dad handles the garden.
  

  
My parents always insist that I don't need to worry about doing anything around the house, but if I don't then they get incredibly short and passive aggressive with me. I appreciate that it's a lot of work for them when I'm not there, and that it doesn't take up my entire day, but it's not relaxing - my ex feels like I'm always an anxious mess after I spend time at my parents', and I believe him.
  

  
The call didn't end well. My mum kept asking ""you don't want to see us?"" until I had to say no, firmly, and then she walked away after accusing me of hating them and calling me ungrateful and lazy. My dad was too angry to talk about it properly so we both agreed that we'd talk the next day (today) when everyone's calmed down.
  

  
I feel terrible about basically telling my parents I don't want to use my time off to visit them, but is it really unreasonable for me to feel this way? Am I the asshole?"
75	304	adjudicated	ESH	"Me (29M) and my ExGF (26F) have a 7 year old together that we have been coparenting from our respective states the past five-ish years. When we had our child we only dated briefly and I moved to my current state with in one year of being born. I’m still a very active father and we have a relatively smooth understanding of our situation now. About five months back me and my Ex happened to hook up during a weekend I spent while gathering our child for my time. Two months later, she informed me that she is pregnant. I wasn’t necessarily disappointed about this but of course I wasn’t ecstatic either. I did let her know that I would want a DNA test as she said it was mine, but due to how much distance there is, I don’t know if I can fully trust it and I’m sure she has “friends” as we don’t hook up regularly at all. Well three days ago, we received the results from the prenatal DNA test, and the child is determined to be mine. I figured we would adjust our custody with the new baby once it comes but today she dropped a bomb on me. She informed me that she wanted to give up custodial rights to the new baby and I raise it as my own while we continue to have a coparenting relationship for our first child. I told her this was absolutely ridiculous because I would still have to make arrangements for our first child while leaving our new child out which can cause a lot of challenges and heartbreak in their future. She then informed me that if I didn’t want to accept this arrangement she would actually put the baby up for adoption as she did not want to be a full-time mother again. I am hurt by this because I don’t see a way out of it. If she decides to give up her rights I am absolutely still going to take on my child but that doesn’t necessarily mean that she’ll have to give up the rights to her first child. To give her credit she is an amazing mother and I know she was not planning to have a child at this time but I feel like there’s so many complications that can come with this dynamic.  I told her if she gives up her rights to the new baby I will fight her in court to get full custody of our first child as well to lessen the complication. She informed me that she would fight back and I can either except or do what I need in court . Again to give her credit. She’s an amazing mother to our first child. I’m just really at a loss of what I could or should even do here. Neither of us planned for this child and I’ve never wanted to force parenthood on anyone but I feel like this is such a tough situation.  Give up neither or Both  ! But that would hurt my oldest too. 

So AITA? is She the AH? Advise ?"
438	13	adjudicated	TTA	"I (18f) and refusing to clean my closet in my parent’s house for a few reasons. 

Reason one is that they have snooped around my room not too long ago and I thought it was done, but it turns out they did it again today, and they don’t care how invasive it is. For instance, they have gone through every drawer and bag in my room to find condoms, lube, sex toys, mace, lighters, and my knife collection; so, they are very upset that I possess these items. 

The second reason is I am currently very sick and they what it all cleaned by tomorrow. Currently I have a headache, can’t stop sneezing, been throwing up, and have a 100.4 degree fever. Despite them being aware of my current state they haven’t stopped yelling and nagging me to clean my closet. 

The third reason is that I am in general super mad at their choices they have been doing. The biggest being when they took all my college savings and used it for my twin brother’s legal fees, medical bills due to drugs, and his rehab. Due to this I can no longer afford going to college next year and it really pisses me off; especially since most of the money in the account was money I earned through chores and when I used to work. 

Still, I do see where they are in the right. That being it is their house, and so they have been proving food and shelter for me. My biggest guess to why they are so invasive in my things ie because they probably want to make sure I’m not doing drugs like my brother. Yet, at the same time I really hate the way they have been treating me, 

Overall, I am still unsure if I’m exactly doing the right thing or if I’m in the right at all."
15	388	adjudicated	INFO	"Aita for not inviting my possible daughter to the court house?

I’m a 21 yo from a small town in the United States and I am writing this bc I’m being treated differently now that I told them no to my possible kid about coming to the court house . I have 3 yo possible kid who I just met back in may of 23 it’s now nov. well last month we had a small gathering at the court house so me and my now wife could get married, when I told the girls grandma they were excited until I told them I didn’t want the child there bc she will cause issues.( she will scream n yell after being told to do something) so to make the day as quite as possible I decided to tell her no for the child coming. Plus on top of it all I’m having a reception next year so this gives us time too see if she is mine. So am I the jerk?"
